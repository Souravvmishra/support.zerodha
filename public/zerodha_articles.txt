Title: Will Zerodha reduce brokerage if the trading volumes are high?
Content: Will Zerodha reduce brokerage if the trading volumes are high?Zerodha cannot provide multiple brokerage structures based on trading volumes due to operational constraints at its scale. Therefore, the charges remain the same for all clients. Zerodha's choice to keep brokerage rates unchanged is based on the fundamental nature of the brokerage industry and its reliance on how the market performs and how unpredictable it is.Even though brokerages can seem like they make a lot of money when the market is doing great, this is not always true. Zerodha knows that how well they do is connected to how the market moves, and this connection is quite strong. Zerodha acknowledges that its business performance is closely tied to the market's movements and volatility, characterized by a high beta i.e. risk factor.

Title: Why is the DP charge applied for Buy Today Sell Tomorrow (BTST) trades?
Content: Why is the DP charge applied for Buy Today Sell Tomorrow (BTST) trades?DP charges are applicable for Buy Today Sell Tomorrow (BTST) trades due to a change in the settlement process. Earlier, shares bought and sold on BTST were credited and debited from the broker's pool account. Now, shares are credited and debited from the client's demat account, even for BTST trades. Since shares are moved out of the client's demat account, DP charges of ₹13 + 18% GST are applicable.If the primary (first) holder of the account is a woman, the DP charges will be reduced to ₹12.75 + 18% GST. The charges are applicable per day and per stock, regardless of the quantity sold.The advantages of crediting and debiting shares from the client's demat account are as follows:For corporate actions like bonuses and splits, the shares are directly credited to the client's demat account. Earlier, they were credited to the broker's pool account, and the broker was responsible for allocating them to the client.Dividends are directly credited to the client's bank account. In case of any TDS on dividends, the dividend issuing company will file against the client's PAN and would reflect in the tax credit statement (Form 26AS) instead of it being passed on from the Broker's PAN.Related articlesHow to do BTST trades at Zerodha?What is BTST and how does it work?How are shares settled in a BTST transaction?What does Depository Participant (DP) charge mean?What are the charges applicable for investing in securities through Coin?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: How is the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) calculated?
Content: How is the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) calculated?If the portion of paise in STT is equal to or more than 50, it will be rounded off to the nearest rupee, and if it is less than 50, it will be rounded down to the nearest rupee. For instance, if the STT is ₹100.60 it will be rounded off to ₹101, and if the STT is ₹100.40 it will be rounded down to ₹100.Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is a direct tax charged on the purchase and sale of securities listed on the exchanges in India.The STT charges for different types of trades are as follows:Order TypeChargeIntraday0.025% on the sell side.Delivery0.1% on both the buy and sell side.Options0.125% of the intrinsic value on options that are bought and exercised.0.0625% of the premium for options that are shorted.Futures0.0125% on the sell side.Since the STT is charged on both the buy and sell side for delivery trades, the average price is to be calculated. The formula to calculate the average price is:Average price = (Buy Qty*Buy Price) + (Sell Qty*Sell Price) / (Buy Qty+Sell Qty)Example scenariosIntraday and delivery500 shares were bought at ₹100 and then sold at ₹105. 200 shares were again bought at ₹110.Average Price = [First Buy (500*100) + Second Buy (200*110) + Sell (500*105)] / [First Buy (500) + Second Buy (200) + Sell (500)]Average Price = (50000 + 22000 + 52500)/1200Average Price = ₹103.75STT for intraday trades = 500 (intraday sell qty) * 103.75 (average price) * 0.025% (STT charge) = ₹13 (₹12.969 rounded off to the nearest rupee)STT for delivery transaction = 200 (buy qty) * 103.75 (average price) * 0.1% (STT charge) = ₹21 (₹20.75 rounded off to the nearest rupee)Futures1 lot of Nifty futures contracts = 50 unitsThe price of 1 unit is = ₹15,000The price of 1 lot of Nifty futures contracts = ₹7,50,000STT = 0.0125% * ₹7,50,000 = ₹94 (₹93.75 rounded off to the nearest rupee)OptionsThe strike price of the Nifty call option = ₹17,000Premium at which the options were sold = ₹60The total premium received = ₹3,000 (50 * ₹60)STT on the premium for options that are shorted = 0.0625% * ₹3,000 = ₹2 (₹1.875 rounded off to the nearest rupee)1 lot of Nifty options contracts = 50 unitsThe strike price of the Nifty call option = ₹17,300The spot price of the Nifty call option = ₹17,350STT on the intrinsic value of options that are bought and exercised = 0.125% * 50 (₹17,350 - ₹17,300) * 50 (1 Lot) = ₹3 (₹3.125 rounded down to the nearest rupee)To learn all the charges involved while trading and investing, visitzerodha.com/charges#tab-equities.To calculate the charges for a particular trade, visitzerodha.com/brokerage-calculator#tab-equities.Related articlesIs securities transaction tax (STT) levied on exchange traded  funds (ETFs)?What happens if the option contract is not squared off on the expiry date?Rights Issues and Rights Entitlements (RE) - FAQsStill need help?Create a ticket

Title: What are clearing charges, and is there any at Zerodha?
Content: What are clearing charges, and is there any at Zerodha?A clearing charge is paid by traders to settle their trade through a clearing agency. The clearing process is a back-end process that determines a broker’s fund and securities obligation and settles them with the exchanges through the clearing mechanism. It ensures the easy settlement of trades with the broking houses and the exchanges.A broker can either self-clear the trades or assign the task of clearing to a Professional Clearing Member (PCM). Since Zerodha is a self-clearing member, it does not levy any clearing charges to its customers. Brokers who require third-party clearing members to clear the trades charge between ₹200 to ₹2,000 per crore or between 0.002% to 0.02% of the option premium.To put this in perspective, on an intraday basis, the Nifty option can be bought and sold at ₹100 (premium), 10 times during the session. The premium turnover, in this case, is  ₹15 lakhs.The clearing charges with other brokers can vary between ₹30 to ₹300.Did you know?Clients may not find clearing charges under a separate heading in the contract note of some brokers. Please check if clearing charges have been combined with exchange transaction charges or charged for different segments, including physical delivery.Related articlesWhat are the MCX transaction charges and why are they different across brokers?What is Account Maintenance Charge (AMC)?What are the various statutory charges associated with trading and investing?Rights Issues and Rights Entitlements (RE) - FAQsWhat is a contract note?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: How are funds in NRI accounts settled after the sale of securities?
Content: How are funds in NRI accounts settled after the sale of securities?The funds for NRI PIS and NRI Non-PIS accounts are settled as follows:PIS accountFunds are settled to the bank account on T+1 and are available for trading from T+2 onward, since it involves RBI reporting and TDS computation by banks.Example scenarioOn Monday (T-Day), stocks are sold from the demat account.Zerodha sends a sell contract note to the bank at the end of the day for reporting and settlement.The proceeds from the sale are credited to the PIS bank account on Tuesday (T+1).On the same day, the bank sends a report to Zerodha with the PIS balance.On Wednesday (T+2), the PIS balance is updated as margins in the Zerodha account before the market opens.Non-PIS accountWhen stocks are sold, the funds are settled in the trading account, but only 60% of the proceeds will be made available for trading on the same day (T-day). The remaining funds will be available for trading the next day (T+1) after Zerodha blocks provisional TDS on capital gains. The provisional TDS is released at the end of the day on T+1, and the entire sale proceeds become available. To learn more about provisional TDS, seeWhat is the “Provisional TDS amount blocked” entry in the ledger?If there is a profit, the actual TDS is deducted after releasing the blocked TDS amount. TDS will not be deducted if there is a loss when the shares are sold.Example scenarioOn Monday (T Day), stocks worth ₹20,000 were sold from the demat account.60% of the sale proceeds, which is ₹12,000, is released on the same day.Zerodha blocks ₹3,588 as provisional TDS (about 17.94%) at the end of the day.By the end of Tuesday (T+1), the provisional TDS of ₹3,588 is reversed, and the entire sale proceeds are available for withdrawal.

Title: How does Zerodha deduct TDS for NRI NON-PIS accounts?
Content: How does Zerodha deduct TDS for NRI NON-PIS accounts?If a Non-PIS account is opened, Zerodha is responsible for deducting Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). Short-term Capital Gains (STCG) and Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) are applicable when trading in the stock markets.The table below explains the taxes:SegmentCapital GainsPeriodSTCGSurchargeCessEquitySTCGLess than 365 days15%15% on STCG4% of STCG plus surchargeLTCGMore than 365 days10%15% on LTCG4% of LTCG plus surchargeNon-EquitySTCGLess than 3 years30%15% on STCG4% of STCG plus surchargeLTCGMore than 3 years20%15% on LTCG4% of LTCG plus surchargeShort-term Capital Gains (STCG):Short-term Capital Gains (STCG) of 17.94% (15% STCG plus 15% surcharge and 4% cess) on profits made applies to stocks sold within 365 days.When shares are sold from a Non-PIS account, Zerodha posts a provisional TDS entry on the ledger at the end of the day at 15% + cess (applicable on the amount received from the shares sold). At the end of the next working day (T+1), the provisional TDS is reversed, and the actual TDS is debited if there is a capital gain from the sale of shares.Example scenarioOn 1st April 2023, 100 shares of Reliance were bought at ₹1,000 per share. The buy value is  ₹1,00,000 (100 shares * ₹1,000 per share).On 30th May 2023, they were sold at ₹900 per share. The sale value is ₹90,000 (100 shares *₹900 per share). Incurring a loss of ₹10,000 (₹1,00,000 - ₹90,000).On 31st May 2023, 100 shares of Reliance were bought again at ₹900 per share. The buy value is ₹90,000 (100 shares * ₹900 per share).On 30th June 2023, they were sold at ₹1,100 per share. The sale value is ₹1,10,000 (100 shares *₹1,100 per share). Incurring a profit of ₹20,000 (1,10,000 - ₹90,000).Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) TDS at a rate of 17.94%, i.e. ₹3588 on the profit of ₹20,000, is charged by Zerodha on 30th June 2023.Initially, the client lost ₹10,000 and then made a profit of ₹20,000, so the net gains for the financial year are ₹10,000, and the applicable TDS is ₹1,790.Long-term Capital Gains (LTCG):There is no Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG) on profits below ₹1,00,000. For TDS on LTCG, Zerodha does not consider the grandfathered effect. On profits above  ₹1,00,000, an LTCG of 11.96% (10% LTCG plus 15% surcharge and 4% cess) is applicable if the shares are held for more than 365 days. Zerodha cannot provide an exemption of ₹1,00,000, as NRIs can have multiple capital gains through mutual funds, accounts with other brokers etc.If a client does not accrue any LTCG, TDS can be claimed while filing tax returns. Contact a tax consultant or Chartered Accountant (CA) for tax-specific queries.The capital gains statement is emailed to the client on the posting day of the actual TDS, i.e. T+1. The statement consists of 3 tables:Summary of Day’s P&L:This table details the booked profits or losses and whether they are long-term or short-term.Summary of TDS Computation:This table summarises the setting-off of losses against the booked profits.Adjusted gainsare the net profits for the day after reducing the carry-forward losses on which TDS is calculated based on the applicable rates.Summary of Carry-forward losses:This table consists of the opening balance of the brought forward losses. Based on the profit or loss booked that day, there can be an addition or a deduction from this figure. Losses booked for the day are accumulated, while sett-off losses are reduced from the brought forward losses. The net figures are carried forward for the next day.Short-term losses (STCL) can be set off against STCG & LTCG.Long-term losses (LTCL) can only be set off with LTCG.If shares are transferred from another broker, update the buy prices for the transferred stocks before selling them. If buy prices are not updated, the TDS will be deducted from the amount received from the sale of shares.Did you know?Losses can be carried forward and set off against future profits within the financial year. For the current year, Zerodha is carrying losses from 1st Oct 2023.The Income Tax Department (ITD) has inactivated PANs that are not linked to Aadhaar from July 1st 2023. PANs of NRIs and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) were exempted but have now been deactivated as the status was not updated as NRI.

Title: How does Zerodha ensure the safety of client data from cyber-attacks and hacking?
Content: How does Zerodha ensure the safety of client data from cyber-attacks and hacking?Zerodha is extremely cautious, and security as a practice is baked into processes when writing code and managing infra. To ensure the safety of client data, some of the common-sense practices are as follows:Regular internal and external penetration testing and audits.Regular human and automated reviews of infrastructure.The default policy is to limit internet exposure. All new pieces added to the infrastructure are disconnected from the internet and reviewed regularly.Cloudflare in front of all public endpoints that provide web app firewall, bot and DDoS protection.Different systems are located on different networks to isolate them from each other.Employee computers are on VPN and require 2FA to access, and access to systems is based on their department and roles.This role-based access is embedded as a practice into the compliance department that clears access and their processes as well.Non-tech employee computers run Linux to reduce the large attack surface of Windows systems.Zerodha self-hosts all internal systems on private networks without the involvement of IT vendors, eliminating third-party maintenance and access.No key or password-based access to AWS cloud resources.Developers use passwordless certificate (+2FA) based SSH logins to critical systems.Client accounts are supported with 2FA and app-based TOTP.

Title: How are Kite app code and external TOTP better than SMS OTP?
Content: How are Kite app code and external TOTP better than SMS OTP?SMS is the most commonly used form of Two Factor Authentication (2FA) across industries. However, unlike other industries, SMS as a 2FA in capital markets has the following disadvantages:Millions of users log into the trading platform during the market opening and volatile instances, sending tens of thousands of time-sensitive login OTP SMSes per second may result in non-delivery or delayed delivery, preventing a user from logging in and squaring off positions on time.As per regulations, users are forcibly logged out of the trading platform at the end of the day and hence are forced to login again each day, exposing them to the risk of SMS non-delivery or delayed delivery.Dependency on telecoms to send SMS is a systemic risk to trading platforms where authentication is to be done timely on a large scale.SMS is an insecure, non-encrypted, non-cryptographic protocol.The contents of SMS can be accessed off the air using hardware close to the device.Sims can be hijacked using simple social engineering attacks like phishing.The advantages of the Kite app code and TOTP over SMS 2FA are as follows:The Kite App Code is cryptographically secure, ensuring only the recipient can view the message.The Kite App Code is only valid for 30 seconds, and a new code is generated once the previous code expires.TOTPs are behind an additional layer of authentication, like biometrics and can be stored and generated on a hardware device.They do not requireexternal network connectivity like an SMS gateway to authenticate.To learn how to set up external TOTP, seeHow to set up Time-based OTP (TOTP) to log in to Kite?Related articlesHow to set up 2FA security to log in to Kite web?How to set up Time-based OTP (TOTP) to log in to Kite?How to log in to the Kite app?When I log in to my Kite account it asks for a temporary OTP after I enter my password.

Title: How does Zerodha ensure the safety of client data from cyber-attacks and hacking?
Content: How does Zerodha ensure the safety of client data from cyber-attacks and hacking?Zerodha is extremely cautious, and security as a practice is baked into processes when writing code and managing infra. To ensure the safety of client data, some of the common-sense practices are as follows:Regular internal and external penetration testing and audits.Regular human and automated reviews of infrastructure.The default policy is to limit internet exposure. All new pieces added to the infrastructure are disconnected from the internet and reviewed regularly.Cloudflare in front of all public endpoints that provide web app firewall, bot and DDoS protection.Different systems are located on different networks to isolate them from each other.Employee computers are on VPN and require 2FA to access, and access to systems is based on their department and roles.This role-based access is embedded as a practice into the compliance department that clears access and their processes as well.Non-tech employee computers run Linux to reduce the large attack surface of Windows systems.Zerodha self-hosts all internal systems on private networks without the involvement of IT vendors, eliminating third-party maintenance and access.No key or password-based access to AWS cloud resources.Developers use passwordless certificate (+2FA) based SSH logins to critical systems.Client accounts are supported with 2FA and app-based TOTP.

Title: How are Kite app code and external TOTP better than SMS OTP?
Content: How are Kite app code and external TOTP better than SMS OTP?SMS is the most commonly used form of Two Factor Authentication (2FA) across industries. However, unlike other industries, SMS as a 2FA in capital markets has the following disadvantages:Millions of users log into the trading platform during the market opening and volatile instances, sending tens of thousands of time-sensitive login OTP SMSes per second may result in non-delivery or delayed delivery, preventing a user from logging in and squaring off positions on time.As per regulations, users are forcibly logged out of the trading platform at the end of the day and hence are forced to login again each day, exposing them to the risk of SMS non-delivery or delayed delivery.Dependency on telecoms to send SMS is a systemic risk to trading platforms where authentication is to be done timely on a large scale.SMS is an insecure, non-encrypted, non-cryptographic protocol.The contents of SMS can be accessed off the air using hardware close to the device.Sims can be hijacked using simple social engineering attacks like phishing.The advantages of the Kite app code and TOTP over SMS 2FA are as follows:The Kite App Code is cryptographically secure, ensuring only the recipient can view the message.The Kite App Code is only valid for 30 seconds, and a new code is generated once the previous code expires.TOTPs are behind an additional layer of authentication, like biometrics and can be stored and generated on a hardware device.They do not requireexternal network connectivity like an SMS gateway to authenticate.To learn how to set up external TOTP, seeHow to set up Time-based OTP (TOTP) to log in to Kite?Related articlesHow to set up 2FA security to log in to Kite web?How to set up Time-based OTP (TOTP) to log in to Kite?How to log in to the Kite app?When I log in to my Kite account it asks for a temporary OTP after I enter my password.

Content: Why was an email and SMS sent by the clearing corporation informing about the allocation of funds?As per SEBI guidelines(WEB),stockbrokers must allocate client funds segment-wise with the Clearing Corporation (CC). This means that the balance maintained with Zerodha will be segregated and allocated segment-wise depending on the trades and margin utilisation. The Clearing Corporation (CC) sends emails and SMS to communicate the segment-wise allocation with clients. Clients are not required to take any action.Example ScenarioIf the balance with Zerodha is ₹1,25,000, the funds can be used to trade in any segment. However, if a trade is taken in the EQ segment, where stocks worth ₹1,00,000 is purchased, the broker needs to allocate ₹20,000 (20% of ₹1,00,000) to the EQ segment with the CC, and ₹1,05,000 will get allocated to other segments based on the percentage of historical margin usage.If the balance with Zerodha is ₹1,25,000, the funds can be used to trade in any segment. However, if no trades are taken in any of the segments, 100% of the cash margin will be allocated to the EQ segment. However, clients can still use the funds to trade across segments.The CC then notifies the client of the allocation made by the broker in different segments.Related articlesHow is withdrawable balance calculated after pledging?What does the Collateral (liquid funds) under Funds mean?What is pledging, and how does it work?When shares are pledged and collateral margin is received, a debit balance is reflected in the funds statement.

For example, Mr A is the primary holder, and Mr B is the secondary holder of the existing demat account. To transfer shares to their Zerodha joint demat account, Mr A must be the primary and Mr B the secondary holder of the account, not vice versa.Securities can be transferred only within the same Beneficiary Owner (BO) status,i.e., they can be transferred only from an individual account to an individual account and not from an individual account to a joint, NRI, or HUF account and vice versa. The BO status can be found on the CMR copy, as shown below:If the securities are under a lock-in period, they cannot be transferred from CDSL to NSDL or vice versa using the closure cum transfer.

The request is approved on confirmation, and the transfer will be done.Did you know?Transfer requests are not processed immediately because Zerodha needs to verify the availability of shares in the customer's demat account. This verification is necessary because there may be instances where the client has initiated a transfer request for a security and sold it on the same day. Off-market transfer requests submitted before 6 PM on trading days will be processed on the same day. However, any requests placed after 6 PM will be rejected.Shares and mutual funds under lock-in cannot be transferred using this flow.The charges to transfer shares in an off-market transaction are 0.03% of the transfer value or ₹25 per ISIN, whichever is higher, + 18% GST. Clients must maintain the required balance for the charges to be debited.To avoid rejection of share transfer, do not sell shares being transferred before the approval of the easiest transaction. In rare cases, the sale transaction may not be rejected and can go to auction. In these cases, auction charges are to be borne by the client. The share transfer will also be rejected if the balance in the trading account is negative.If the account is dormant, clients must complete the Re-KYC process.

Title: Are there any income tax implications on the gifting of shares?
Content: Are there any income tax implications on the gifting of shares?A gift may be in the form of money, immovable or movable property. Understanding the tax implications and disclosure in Income Tax returns and maintaining documentation is important. To learn more about taxes, visitlearn.quicko.com/tax-gifted-shares-securities.Tax implications in the hands of the sender of the gift¹:The sender of the gift is not liable to pay taxes as the Gift Tax Act (GTA) was abolished. According to the Income Tax Act, capital gains can arise from the transfer of a capital asset. However,giftis expressly excluded from the definition oftransferunder Section 47. Therefore, income tax on such a transaction is not liable to be paid by the sender of a gift.Tax implications in the hands of the receiver of the gift:Under Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, the recipient is liable to be taxed for gifts of movable property, such as shares, ETFs, mutual funds, jewellery, drawings, etc., without consideration and exceeding the fair market value of more than ₹50,000. Income from such gifts should be reported under the headIncome from Other Sourcesin the Income Tax Return, and tax at slab rates should be paid.Taxes on thegifting of sharesare exempt in the following situations:Individuals receiving gifts from a relative (including siblings, spouse and lineal ascendants or descendants). To learn more, visitlearn.quicko.com/gift-under-income-tax-act#exempt.Individuals receive gifts on the occasion of marriage.Gift received by inheritance.On the sale of the gift:If shares, ETFs, mutual funds, etc., are received as a gift and subsequently sold, the income would be taxable under the headIncome from Capital Gains.Tax at applicable rates should be paid, and the recipient should file ITR-2.  To learn more, visitlearn.quicko.com/tax-gifted-shares-securitiesandlearn.quicko.com/equity-share-trading-income-tax-treatment.The holding period for determining the nature of Capital Gains, whether STCG or LTCG, would be determined from the date of acquisition by the previous owner until the date of sale. The capital asset acquisition cost would be determined as the previous owner's purchase price to compute the capital gains.To justify the genuineness of the gift transaction, proper documentation, such as a gift deed, should be maintained by the sender and recipient. In case of high gift amounts, there are chances of scrutiny from the tax department.Notes¹At Zerodha, for tracking and reporting purposes, the stock's closing price on the day the stock gets transferred is the exit price for the person gifting the stock, and the same price is used as an entry price for the person receiving the gift.

Title: Why was an email received from CDSL stating UCC is delinked from the demat account?
Content: Why was an email received from CDSL stating UCC is delinked from the demat account?A circular issued by SEBI(WEB)that mandates the mapping of a client's Unique Client Code (UCC), with which they open an account with a broker, and their demat account number (BO ID) is the reason behind the email. The purpose of this requirement is to establish systematic checks. To learn more about client code and BO ID, seeWhat is the user ID to log in to Zerodha’s trading platform?AndWhat are DP name, DP ID, BO ID and demat ID?The mapping enables regulators to ensure that shares sold by a client are debited from their account and shares purchased by the client are credited to their account. The mapping occurs between the UCC, demat account, trading member ID (broker ID), clearing member ID, and account segments. Therefore, if a Zerodha trading and demat account is opened, the mapping occurs on the back-end (backend of exchange {NSE and BSE} + depository {CDSL} clearing corporation {NCL}).The Zerodha Client ID is mapped with the following:Zerodha demat account number.Zerodha's trading member ID with the exchange.Zerodha's clearing member ID with the clearing corporation.Segments that are enabled in the account (NSE, BSE, NFO, CDS, etc.).All client IDs with different brokers get mapped to all the demat accounts that have been opened. If a client has multiple trading accounts with different brokers, their demat account at Zerodha will be mapped to all the unique client codes. For example, if a client has 5 trading accounts (including Zerodha) with 5 stockbrokers, the demat account at Zerodha will be mapped to 5 different Unique Client Codes.The mapping between the UCC and the demat account changes based on the status of the UCC. If a broker changes the status of the UCC fromActivetoInactiveorClosed,the UCC to demat linking gets unmapped or de-linked. In this case, one of the other brokers that the client has an account with has changed the status of their client ID fromActivetoInactiveat their end, resulting in the delinking of the UCC from the Zerodha demat account. CDSL send an email to notify the client of the same.The changes made by CDSL will not affect the trading activity with Zerodha, and the email can be ignored. CDSL will inform the client of the changes made to their system the next day.

To validate the physical share certificate, visitbseindia.com/index.htmland enter the company name or ISIN. If the face value on the certificate does not match the current face, clients must contact the Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTA) to get the updated certificate. To learn more about RTA, seeWhat are Registrar and Transfer agents (RTA)?To dematerialise physical share certificates, the following documents need to be submitted:Two copies of the dematerialisation request form (DRF)(PDF)for up to four share certificates of the same company. If the share certificates are in sequence (1505101,1505102,1505103 etc.), submitting two DRF forms will suffice even if there are more than four certificates.

Content: When does cash settlement happen to close out short delivery?For a video walkthrough on auction markets and how to participate in them, seeWhat are auction markets and how to easily participate in them on Zerodha?Cash settlement to the trading account usually happens on T+2 day if the exchange is unable to obtain the shares in the auction. The probability of cash settlement is lower for liquid stocks and higher for illiquid stocks. To learn more about short delivery, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?Did you know?The price at which the transaction is settled to the trading account, known as the close-out price, is generally over 20% higher than the stock's closing price on auction day. This amount can be used to purchase the stocks again once the cash has been credited to the trading account.Example scenario100 shares of Oriental Trimex are bought at ₹15 per share, which are short-delivered.The exchange tries to find sellers who can deliver 100 shares of Oriental Trimex in the auction market to deliver to the client’s demat account.The trade gets cash settled if there are no sellers in the auction market.If the closing price of Oriental Trimex on the auction date was ₹18, the exchange cash settles the trade at ₹21.6 (20% higher than 18).The seller who defaulted pays ₹2160 (21.6 * 100 shares), and the buyer receives ₹2160.If the price of Oriental Trimex reaches ₹25 from the day of trading till the auction day, then the cash settlement is done at ₹25 instead of ₹21.6.This is because cash settlement always happens at whichever is higher of the following:The closing price on auction day + 20%.The highest price of the stock from trading day till the auction date.In the event of short delivery of AAA and above-rated bonds or debentures, the closing price will be the greater of the highest exchange rate from the start of the trading period to the close-out day, or 5% above the auction day's official closing price. For bonds and debentures rated below AAA, a 20% close-out markup is applied.To learn more, seezerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/consequences-of-short-delivery-nse-bse.Related articlesWhat are auction markets and how to participate in them on Kite?Why has the fund balance increased but shares are missing from holdings?What is short delivery and what are its consequences?Why are the purchased shares not visible in the holdings?Why are clients unable to sell their pledged holdings in the post-market session and in the auction market?Still need help?Create a ticket

This generally occurs when intraday short positions cannot be closed because of illiquidity or stocks hitting the upper circuit. To learn more about circuit limits, seeWhat are circuit limits or price bands?The consequences of short delivery are different for the buyer and the seller and are as follows:BuyerHow to know if the shares have been short-delivered?Buyers are notified through email and a Kite notification when a short delivery happens. A short-delivery tag is also displayed beside the short-delivered stock.Kite appThe short-delivered quantity is displayed for the stock.Kite webHovering over the tag displays the short-delivered quantity.When will the shares be credited after a short delivery?The shares will be credited to the buyer’s demat account on T+2 day after the exchange holds an auction on T+1 day to procure the short-delivered shares. If the exchange cannot procure the shares in the auction, the Zerodha account will be credited with cash based on the close-out price. See,When does cash settlement happen to close out short delivery?Example ScenarioShares are purchased on Monday (T day) and are tagged as T1 holdings until Tuesday (T+1 day).If the shares were not delivered on Tuesday (T+1 day), a short delivery tag is applied to the stock on Wednesday (T+2 day).The exchange delivers the shares procured from the auction market held on Tuesday (T+1 day) and delivers them on Wednesday (T+2 day). The shares will be visible on Kite from Thursday (T+3 day).SellerWhat happens when the seller defaults?The exchange conducts an auction to deliver the short quantities from other sellers. For shares sold on Monday, the auction happens on Tuesday, with the closing price of Monday used to determine the auction price. The price range of the auction is capped at 20% at the upper and lower end.The exchange delivers the shares to the buyer’s demat at the auction price on Wednesday, and the defaulting seller is sent an auction note and is obligated to pay an auction penalty to the exchange.Example scenario100 shares are sold on Monday (T day) at ₹800 per share. The stock hits the upper circuit, and there are no sellers.The exchange conducts an auction on Tuesday (T+1 day) and uses the closing price of Monday (T day) to determine the auction price. If the closing price were ₹830, the auction price range would be ₹664 to ₹996, i.e. 20% upper and lower of the closing price.If the auction price were ₹920, on Wednesday (T+2 day) the seller would have to pay ₹12,000 [(₹920 - ₹800)*100].Did you know?If the auction price is lesser than the closing price on T day, the higher price is used to calculate the auction penalty, and the difference between the auction price and the closing price is transferred to the investor protection fund.Related articlesWhy has the fund balance increased but shares are missing from holdings?Why are the purchased shares not visible in the holdings?What is BTST and how does it work?What are the risks involved in BTST?What are auction markets and how to participate in them on Kite?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are circuit limits or price bands?
Content: What are circuit limits or price bands?Circuit limits, or price bands, are safeguards set by the exchange to prevent large movements in the price of stocks in a very short time. When the price of an instrument hits the upper or lower circuit limit set by the exchange, orders will remain pending at that circuit price for that particular stock or contract( EQ, FNO, CDS or MCX).The price band determines the price range within which the stock can be traded for that day. The circuit limits, which range from 2 to 20%, depend on the liquidity, volume, and category of the stocks. The upper and lower circuit for a particular instrument can be found in the market depth on Kite.Orders placed out of the price band will be rejected, and if the price drops to the upper or lower price band, the orders will remain pending till the limits are relaxed. To know what happens when the MIS position and circuit limits are hit, seeWhat will happen to my intraday (MIS/CO) position in case the stock circuit limits are hit?Did you know?Equities with Futures & Options (F&O) contracts don't have fixed circuit limits for the day. However, there is a dynamic price band of 10%. The exchange has a fixed operating range of 10% on either side to ensure trading is done within the specified range. When the price approaches these levels, the limits are relaxed further. There is currently a cooling period of 15 minutes before new limits are added for F&O stocks.Related articlesWhy is the order pending on Kite?Why is the circuit limit showing differently on Kite after the stocks circuit limit has already been hit?What are market-wide circuit breakers?What is short delivery and what are its consequences?What will happen to my intraday (MIS/CO) position in case the stock circuit limits are hit?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why have I been charged margin penalty?
Content: What is a margin penalty, and why is it charged?A margin penalty is a charge imposed for failing to maintain sufficient margin in a trading account. Clients are required by exchanges to maintain adequate margins for their trades and to transfer funds in the event of a margin shortfall, which means a deficit of funds or margin in the trading account.There are two types of margin penalties:1. Upfront margin penaltyUpfront margin refers to the margin that must be provided in order to initiate a trade. The broker will be charged an upfront margin penalty if the trader doesn't have sufficient margin in their account when entering a trade.Example scenarioIf the broker lets a trader enter a position with a minimum margin of ₹1.1 lakh (SPAN + Exposure), but the trader only has ₹1 lakh in their account, there will be a shortfall of ₹10,000, resulting in a penalty being imposed on that amount.2. Non-upfront margin penaltyNon-upfront margin pertains to the margins that should be fulfilled by the client after initiating a trade, following the fulfilment of the upfront margin requirement. If the client fails to provide the required funds within the deadline, it leads to a deficit and may result in a penalty. If there are marked-to-market (MTM) losses in futures contracts, the client has until T+1 day till 11.59 PM to add the funds. Failure to do so is considered a non-upfront margin deficit and can lead to a penalty. Additionally, ad-hoc margin requirements added by exchanges owing to volatility or physical delivery margins to stock F&O contracts in the last week of expiry are also deemed non-upfront margins. If a penalty is charged for non-upfront margins, the corresponding fund statement entry will be posted on the T+6th day, as margin reporting is due on T+5 days.Visittradingqna.com/t/nse-circular-on-short-margin-penalty-refund/136203/26for more detailed examples of upfront and non-upfront margin penalties.Related articlesWhat are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?What is Value at Risk (VAR), Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), and Adhoc margins?What is a daily margin statement, and how to understand it?Will brokerage and taxes be considered when margins are blocked for trades in the commodity segment?How to place basket orders on Kite?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is there no price movement in the stock’s option contracts when the price of the stock and its futures contract is moving?
Content: Why is there no price movement in the stock’s option contracts when the price of the stock and its futures contract is moving?The price movement only occurs if there is trading activity in a stock or a contract. If there is no price movement for the options contract even though the underlying stock and future contract are moving, it means that the option contract is not actively traded. The trading activity of any instrument can be checked by seeing the Last Traded Time (LTT). The LTT displays the time when a particular share or contract was last bought or sold.To see the LTT of any instrument, open the market depth of an instrument.There might be fluctuation in the bid and offer or chart of an instrument even though it’s not traded due to the following reasons:Bid and offer:The bid and the offer prices could be moving, but the Last Traded Price (LTP) would not have moved at all. This is because the top 5 bid and ask prices are displayed in the market depth window at all times by default, even if there is no trading activity in the instrument.Charts:The charts generally show dashes for a particular option contract until trades happen, after which the candles are formed. Even if the bid and offer prices for the contract are moving, charts only capture the LTP; hence LTT needs to be checked to see the trading activity in a particular contract.

However, the stock can be sold even before receiving it in the demat account.Example ScenarioAssume a client has ₹10,000 in the Zerodha account.On Monday, 5 shares of Reliance are bought at ₹2000 each.On Tuesday, the same 5 shares of Reliance are sold at ₹2100 each.Buy Value = ₹10,000/-Sell Value = ₹10,500/-₹10,000 in the Zerodha account is blocked immediately on Monday towards the purchase of Reliance shares.

Title: Why is MIS not allowed for certain instruments?
Content: Why are intraday (MIS/CO) orders not allowed for some stocks?Intraday (MIS/CO) orders are not allowed for some stocks due to regulatory or risk management reasons. These types of orders provide leverage, allowing traders to trade with more funds than they have in their Zerodha account. However, stockbrokers may restrict intraday orders for certain stocks to mitigate potential risks. In such cases, traders can only place delivery (CNC) orders for those particular stocks. To learn more about product types, seeWhat does CNC, MIS and NRML mean?Intraday orders may be blocked due to the high risk of being unable to exit the intraday position, which can potentially lead to short delivery in certain situations. To learn more about short delivery, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?There are several reasons why intraday orders can be blocked, including:Volatile markets or sudden movements:During periods of high volatility, specific intraday order types (MIS/CO) may be blocked to prevent clients from incurring losses beyond their available account funds and to mitigate credit risk for the broker.Low liquidity or volume:If a stock has low liquidity or trading volume, intraday orders may be blocked to ensure that there is sufficient market depth for smooth order execution.Small circuit limit range:Intraday orders can be blocked for stocks with a small circuit limit range to avoid excessive price fluctuations and potential market manipulation. To learn more about circuit limits, seeWhat are circuit limits or price bands?IPO listing day:On the day of an initial public offering (IPO) listing, when market volatility is typically high, intraday orders may be blocked to manage risk and protect investors.High margin requirement and potential margin penalty:Stocks with high margin requirements may have intraday trading blocked to avoid margin penalties that may be incurred due to inadequate margin coverage. To learn more about margin penalty, seeWhat is a margin penalty, and why is it charged?Regulatory restrictions:Stocks categorized as Trade-to-Trade(WEB),ASM (Additional Surveillance Measures)(WEB),GSM (Graded Surveillance Measures)(WEB),or Unsolicited SMS category are blocked from intraday trading due to regulatory restrictions.Intraday orders can be blocked for any instrument based on Zerodha's policy.

Title: Why is the account in debit after placing a stop-loss order?
Content: Why is the account in debit after placing a stop-loss order?The reason for the debit in the account after placing the SL (Stop Loss) could be due to a hedged position. Hedging is a strategy used to safeguard trading positions from potential losses in case of unfavourable market movements.A margin benefit is provided for hedged positions, which reduces the funds required for trading. To learn more about hedging, visitzerodha.com/varsity/chapter/hedging-futures.Consider a scenario where two open positions are hedged against each other. Placing a SL order for one of the positions eliminates the hedge, treating both positions as separate open positions. Consequently, the margin requirement for these two positions increases immediately. If sufficient funds are not available in the account to cover the margin for an unhedged position, an SMS and email will be sent regarding the margin shortfall. Adding funds to the account can prevent automatic square off (closing/exiting) of the position.Alternatively, monitoring the hedged position manually and exiting when necessary can be an alternative to placing a SL order. To retain the margin benefit on hedged positions, it is possible to use a GTT (Good Till Triggered) order instead of a Stop Loss order. To learn more about GTT, seeHow to use the Good Till Triggered (GTT) feature?Example ScenarioIf a long Nifty position is hedged with a short call position, ₹1,62,000 will be blocked in the trading account, considering the hedging margin benefit.Placing a Stop Loss order for Nifty May 15000 CE removes the hedge and results in the loss of the margin benefit. As a result, the complete margin of ₹2,94,315 will be blocked in the trading account.Insufficient funds in the account will trigger SMS and email notifications for a margin call.Opting to place a GTT order instead of a Stop Loss order will maintain the blocked funds at ₹1,62,000, ensuring the retention of the margin benefit.Related articlesBy when should additional margins be added if a margin call is received?Why was an email and voice message received for the provisional margin shortfall?Why is the entire margin required to enter into a hedged position?Why should clients transfer funds to cover margin shortfalls?What does the 'delivery margin' field on Zerodha Kite mean?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Starting from 8:00 AM, all authorizations will be recorded for trades executed on the same day until 5:00 PM. After 5:00 PM, individuals can place After Market Orders (AMO) for the following day by pre-authorizing their holdings at the time of order placement. For these AMO orders, there is no need to provide holdings authorization again the next day unless the order is modified.However, clients must provide a new authorization every trading day after 8 AM if they plan to sell their holdings.

Title: Why isn't the order getting executed even though it has been placed successfully?
Content: Why isn't the order getting executed even though it has been placed successfully?Due to certain circumstances, the order may not be executed despite being successfully placed. In situations where there is extremely negative news about the company, stock prices can rapidly decline. Consequently, the stock continuously hits lower circuit limits on a daily basis, resulting in a lack of new buyers willing to purchase these shares. This occurrence is commonly observed in penny stocks that lack liquidity. To learn more about circuit limits, seeWhat are circuit limits or price bands?Similarly, when there is significant buying pressure and demand for a particular stock, there can be numerous bids but a shortage of sellers willing to trade these shares. As a result, the execution of the order may be delayed or prevented altogether.When placing an order during normal market hours, order matching on the exchange follows a price-time priority system. This means orders are executed on a "first come, first serve" basis, similar to a queue system. If other individuals have placed prior orders, the order will only be executed once those preceding orders are filled.To potentially move ahead in the queue, there are a few options available:Place an After Market Order (AMO) - This can be a Limit or Market order, and it is advisable to do so after 3:45 PM. Market orders generally have a higher chance of being filled. To learn more about AMO, seeWhat is an AMO and how to place it?Place a market or limit order during the pre-market session, which begins at 9:00 AM. To learn more about pre-market sessions, seeWhat are pre-market and post-market sessions and orders in NSE and BSE?Placing a pre-market order typically has a better chance of being executed compared to an AMO. However, choosing an AMO offers more convenience as it allows orders to be placed anytime between 3:45 PM to 8:57 AM for NSE and 3:45 PM to 8:59 AM for BSE without waiting for the pre-market timings.Did you know?Despite placing an AMO or pre-market order, there is no assurance that the order will be executed.

Title: What are Differential Voting Rights (DVR) shares?
Content: What are Differential Voting Rights (DVR) shares?Differential Voting Rights (DVRs) shares provide shareholders with either higher or lower voting rights in comparison to ordinary shareholders of the company. When a shareholder has higher voting rights in a ratio of 10:1, it means they have 10 votes per share held. Conversely, lower voting rights in a ratio of 1:10 means having 1 vote for every 10 shares held.However, Indian regulations prohibit companies from issuing equity shares with higher voting rights. As a result, the DVR shares available in the market typically have limited voting rights. These shares are traded on the stock exchange similar to ordinary shares but often at a discounted price and with a higher dividend.Example ScenarioA Tata Motor DVR has 10% voting rights compared to an ordinary Tata Motor share.Tata MotorsTata Motors DVRVoting Rights1:1 (1 voting right per share.)1:10 (1 voting right for every 10 shares held.)Dividend payoutLower dividend than Tata Motors DVR5% more dividend than Tata MotorsReasons for issuing DVRsPrevention of hostile takeover:Since DVRs are issued with limited voting rights, they do not dilute the promoters voting rights and make it difficult for hostile takeovers.Bring in Passive/Retail investors:Passive/Retail investors may not want to indulge in the managerial operations of a business in which they are investing. In most cases, such investors are looking only to make profits. DVR shares are ideal as investors can focus on the dividend generation aspect, without needing to deal with the decision-making aspect of the company. DVR shares are offered at a discount compared to ordinary shares because of the lower voting rights. In turn, investors can acquire more shares at a lower price, thus increasing their dividend earning potential.Related articlesWhat is a Right Entitlement?What happens if I buy/receive REs but don't apply for rights shares?Rights Issues and Rights Entitlements (RE) - FAQsWhat is Demat Debit and Pledge Instruction (DDPI)?××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Content: Why has the fund balance increased but shares are missing from holdings?Shares may not appear in the holdings after they are purchased if they are short-delivered. To learn more about short delivery, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?In such a scenario, there are two possible outcomes. Firstly, on the T+2 day, the individual may receive the shares that were previously short-delivered. Alternatively, if the exchange is unable to acquire the shares on behalf of the individual, the transaction may be settled in cash. In this case, the exchange settles the transaction by providing a cash credit based on the close-out rate. The close-out rate is determined as the higher of the stock's highest price from the time of sale to the auction day or 20% above the closing price on the auction day (T+1).

Title: What are partly paid shares?
Content: What are partly paid shares?A partly paid share refers to a share in a company that has been paid for partially, instead of paying the full issue price upfront. This allows investors to acquire these shares without making the complete payment at the beginning. The remaining amount for partly paid shares can be paid in instalments when the company issues a call for payment.Suppose we have a company with a stock price of ₹100. An investor decides to buy a share for ₹75. Sometime later, the company might ask the shareholder to pay the outstanding balance of ₹25 (or make an instalment payment). When you invest in partly paid shares, keep in mind that the company may request additional funds from time to time until the shares are completely paid off.Now, let's address a few common questions that may arise regarding partly paid shares.Q. Is it possible to sell partly paid shares before the call date?A. Yes, investors have the option to sell partly paid shares before the call date.Q. Are partly paid shares tradable in the market?A. Yes, partly paid shares can be traded in the markets until they are suspended two days before the ex/record date.Q. How and when are call payments made for partly paid shares?A. The Registrar & Transfer Agent (RTA) of the company will provide a website link for the payment of call money. All communication from the RTA will be sent to the email ID associated with the Zerodha account. Payments for the call money should be made from the shareholders' bank account, as payments from third-party accounts are not eligible.Q. What are the consequences of not making the call payment?A. There are several potential outcomes if the call money is not paid. Firstly, currently held partly paid shares may be forfeited by the company. As a result, these shares would become worthless and would not be tradable on exchanges. The company may then proceed to issue new partly-paid shares under a different ISIN (International Security Identification Number).Additionally, the company may impose interest on the unpaid amount. The specific interest rate would depend on the number of partly paid shares held.What happens after paying the first call to the company?The company will allocate new partly-paid shares to clients under a new ISIN (International Security Identification Number), which will be fully paid up to the amount they have already paid (including initial application money and the first call money). Once the first call payment is collected, these newly allotted partly-paid shares will be listed again, enabling clients to trade them. These shares will be visible under the new ISIN in the Zerodha Kite holding.Related articlesWhat is the correct buy average for the partly-paid shares?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Content: Where can one obtain Form 10DB at Zerodha?Form 10DB previously served as proof of payment of Securities Transaction Tax (STT) for claiming a tax rebate under section 88E of the Income Tax Act. However, starting from the Assessment Year 2009-10, no rebate is permitted under section 88E because STT is now considered a business expense eligible for deduction. The Tax P&L(WEB)available on Zerodha's Console can be utilised to fulfil this requirement.

Title: What are the risks involved in BTST?
Content: What are the risks involved in BTST?BTST (Buy Today Sell Tomorrow) - Trades where the shares are bought and sold on the next trading day, i.e. T+1 day.The risk with BTST trades is that since the clients are selling shares that aren't in their demat account yet, they rely on the seller they’ve bought the shares from to give them the stock. If the seller defaults on giving them the shares, i.e. in the event of short delivery, the client’s obligation as a seller to deliver shares won't be met, and the clients will face the risk of auction penalty, which can be up to 20% of the value of stock short delivered.

Title: Why is there a difference between the LTP and closing price on NSE?
Content: Why is there a difference between the LTP and closing price on NSE?The reason for the difference between the closing price on the NSE and the last traded price (LTP) is that the LTP represents the actual last traded price, while the NSE's closing price is calculated as a weighted average of the last 30 minutes of trading. As a result, the closing price on the daily charts also does not match the LTP since it is updated using the NSE Bhavcopy's closing price.Related articlesWhy does the Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) of historical data on the Kite charts sometimes not match the records updated in NSE or BSE?Why do the colour on bar charts and volume bars not match sometimes?How are the pivot points derived while using the Central Pivot Range (CPR)?How to close the Zerodha account?Why does the LTP under holdings not match with the Marketwatch?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is a daily margin statement, and how to understand it?
Content: What is a daily margin statement, and how to understand it?A daily margin statement is a report that provides clients with information regarding their margins. It includes information on deposited margins, such as fund transfers and pledged collaterals, as well as blocked margins for held or taken positions. The report aims to inform clients of the following:Margin required by the exchanges for the positions taken or held.Availability of free margins in the account to take new positions.Margin shortfall in the account so that the clients can maintain adequate funds to avoid any margin penalty. To learn more, seeWhat are margins and how can margin shortfall occur?The daily margin statement is sent to the registered email address on the days when the client has traded. Alternatively, it can also be downloaded by visitingconsole.zerodha.com/reports/downloads.Understanding the Daily margin statementMargin AvailableTheMargin Availablesection provides details of cash balance, margin received from pledging shares (collateral margin) and value of shares sold from the demat account, which can be considered towards the margin, also referred to as Early Payin(EPI) margin.Here’s a detailed explanation of the four columns in this section:Funds - Annex A: This column shows the fund balance after reversing the effect of T-day credits and debits of the Equity, F&O and CDS (Currency derivative) segments. Reversing means deducting the unsettled credit obligation and adding back the unsettled debit obligation because it takes T+1 day for Equity, F&O and CDS amounts to get settled. Let’s understand this with an example.Example ScenarioMr A has a fund balance of ₹1,00,000 on Tuesday. He bought options worth ₹30,000 and Reliance shares worth ₹20,000 and sold TataMotors worth ₹30,000 on Tuesday. His closing balance on Tuesday is ₹80,000. The calculation of the fund balance is as follows:Tuesday’s (T-Day) closing balance80,000ADD: Unsettled debitsSum of options and shares bought on Tuesday (T Day)50,000LESS: Unsettled creditsShares sold on Tuesday ( T Day)30,000Unencumbered Balance (Fund balance)Funds available on Tuesday (T Day)1,00,000The settlement cycle for all instruments is T+1 Day. Hence the unsettled credits and debits for all the segments are reversed for T day. To learn more, seeWhat does settlement cycle mean?The detailed breakdown of this calculation is explained in Annex A.Value of Securities - Annex B: This column shows the collateral margins. Collateral margins are the margins received from pledging the stocks after the applicable haircut. Annex B explains the break up of securities pledged. To learn more, seeWhat does Collateral(Equity) in the ‘funds’ mean?Any other approved form of Margins (EPI) - Annex C: Shares sold from the client's demat account are transferred to the exchange’s account on the Trade day. Sale value from such sold securities is considered as the available margin towards the subsequent margin requirement of the client. Early Pay-in(EPI) value is calculated by taking 80% of T Day sell value.Margin RequiredTheMargin requiredsection indicates the exchange mandated margins to initiate the trades in respective segments.Here’s a detailed explanation of the five columns in this section:Upfront Margin required: This column shows the upfront margins. Upfront margin is the minimum amount required to take a trade and is to be collected on an upfront basis on trade day. Upfront margins for each segment are as follows:EQ = Minimum margin + Additional marginF&O = Span Margin + Extreme Loss MarginCDS = Span Margin + Extreme Loss MarginMCX = Span MarginTo learn more, seeWhat is SPAN and exposure margin?andWhat is Value at Risk (VAR), Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), and Adhoc margins?Consolidated Crystallised Obligation: This column shows the sum of MTM loss margin or option premium payable in the respective segment. It shows the due or non-upfront margins, which means that they can be collected till T+1 day.In the case of MCX, Consolidated crystalised obligation margin is referred as MTM margin. To learn more, seeWhat is Mark to Market (MTM)?Delivery Margin required: This column shows the physical delivery margins charged by the exchange for In The Money (ITM) options held till expiry. Exchange levies physical delivery margins as a percentage of applicable margins (VAR + ELM + Adhoc) of the underlying stock, which is levied from expiry minus four days. To learn more, seeWhat is Zerodha's policy on the physical settlement of equity derivatives on expiry?Total End of the day (EOD) Margin required: This column shows the total amount blocked by the exchange for the position, segment-wise. This is calculated as total upfront margin + consolidated crystallised obligation + delivery margin (in case of F&O)Total Peak Margin required: This column shows the highest peak margin required from the snapshots taken by the exchange.

Title: Why is the opening price of a stock different from its previous day's closing price on Kite?
Content: Why is the opening price of a stock different from its previous day's closing price on Kite?Let us first understand the meaning of the closing and opening prices and how they are calculated for a stock.Closing PriceThe closing price is a stock's trading price at the end of a trading day. This makes it the most recent price of a stock until the next trading session. For equities, the market timing is from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM. In the case of equity, the closing price is calculated as the weighted average price of the last 30 minutes, i.e., from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM.Example scenarioThe closing price is ₹51.48, which is different from the last traded price at 3:30 PM, i.e., ₹54.To know more about the closing price and how it differs from the Last Traded Price (LTP), visittradingqna.com/t/how-to-determine-closing-price-in-f-o/584.Opening PriceThe opening price is the price at which a stock first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day. For equities, the market timing is from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM. But, the exchange starts collecting orders from 9:00 AM till 9:08 AM, called as pre-market window. During this time, they collect the orders, and 7 minutes before markets open, they match these orders to decide at what price the stock will open for the day at 9:15 AM. To learn more about market timings, seeWhat are the market timings?There's a pre-market window within which the opening price is calculated, and depending upon the demand and supply of a stock, the opening price may differ from its previous day's closing price.In the hours between the closing price and the next trading day's opening price, the price of a particular stock can be affected due to several factors, such as:After market order(AMO):AMO has a major effect on the stock price between the closing and opening price because it means that orders are being placed even after the markets are closed, which results in changing the prices of stocks. To know more about After market orders(AMO), seeWhat is an AMO and when can we place it?News about a company:News about a company can be released while the market is closed, changing what investors are prepared to pay to own a company's share and changing the price of the company's stock without any trades occurring.

Title: How to short sell shares in equity and futures?
Content: How to short sell shares in equity and futures?A short sale (or short sell) is a trade taken when a trader feels that the price of the security is likely to decline from its current price. In a short sale transaction, the security is sold first and bought back later on.EquityTo short inEquity (EQ)segment, the order must be placed using intraday order type, i.e. MIS (Margin Intraday Square Off) or CO (Cover Order).

Title: What are Open interest limits?
Content: What are Open interest limits?Open interest limits(WEB)refer to the maximum allowed open interest for a particular derivative contract. In addition to complying with the exchange-mandated initial margin requirements, brokers must also adhere to position limits. Open Interest (OI) indicates the total number of outstanding (open) futures or options contracts in the market.There is a client-wise limit of 5% of the total number of all derivative contracts for the same underlying and a 15% limit on open interest for trading members (brokers).

Title: What are the risks associated with the physical delivery of stock Futures & Options (F&O)?
Content: What are the risks associated with the physical delivery of stock Futures & Options (F&O)?The physical delivery of stock derivatives can result in potential systemic risk in the Indian capital markets and pose a significant threat to traders. If a customer holds stock futures or in-the-money stock options at the time of expiry, they must give or take delivery of the entire contract's stock value. This increases the risk for clients who do not have enough cash to take delivery or stocks to give delivery. As a result, the margins required to hold a future or short option position increase as the expiry date approaches, with a minimum of 50% of the contract value or 1.5 times NRML margin (whichever is lower).Moreover, even In-The-Money (ITM) long or buy option positions require a delivery margin four days before expiry. The margins for long ITM options increase from 10% of VaR + ELM +  Adhoc margins to 50% of the contract value, with 50% of the contract value required on the last day of expiry. The broker squares off the contract if the customer lacks sufficient funds or stocks to give or take delivery. If the customer shows an intent to hold after the higher margin is blocked, it indicates their intent to give or take delivery.The risk, however, arises from out-of-the-money (OTM) options that suddenly become ITM on the last day of expiry. No additional margins are blocked for OTM options in the expiry week, and if they suddenly become ITM, a customer with small amounts of premium and no margin can get assigned to give or take large delivery positions, posing a significant risk to the trader and the brokerage firm.To learn more about the risks of physical delivery of stock F&O, visitzerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/physical-delivery-of-stock-fo-their-risks.Related articlesWhat are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?Why is higher than usual margin blocked for my F&O trades close to expiry?What is Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) and how to avail it?What does the 'delivery margin' field on Zerodha Kite mean?What are margins and how can margin shortfall occur?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: How is buy average calculated for F&O trades?
Content: How is buy average calculated for F&O trades?If the same contract is traded multiple times, the average price of the positions may change. The buy average for F&O positions is calculated using the FIFO (First In, First Out) method, regardless of the product type used to close the positions (MIS or NRML).Since all trades must use the FIFO method, it's best to use the same method to calculate the P&L when filing income tax returns. Please consult a CA before deviating from the FIFO method used on Kite and Console.Let’s consider the following trades to understand FIFO:DateSymbolTrade TypeQuantityRate (₹)06th AugNIFTY18AUGFUTBuy751100007th AugNIFTY18AUGFUTBuy751110007th AugNIFTY18AUGFUTSell7511050In the above case, the buy trade executed on 06th August will be the open quantity at the end of the day; hence, the average price of the open quantity on 07th August will be ₹11100. This logic does not change regardless of the product type used (NRML/MIS) for the trades on 07th August.The P&L will show a booked profit of ₹3750 [i.e. (11050-11000)*75], and the position will show the difference between the current market price and ₹11100 as the gain/loss for the open position. The same FIFO logic is applicable for both carried forward (NRML) and intra-day (MIS) trades. However, MIS positions can only be exited using MIS product type, and the same goes for NRML. An NRML position cannot be exited using MIS product type and vice versa.Related articlesHow is the buy average calculated in Console?How can multiple trades for shares transferred to the Zerodha account be added?Why is the buy average for some mutual funds shown as a discrepancy?Why has the average price been reduced after receiving bonus shares in Zerodha?How is the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) calculated?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is F&O (Futures and Options)?
Content: What is F&O (Futures and Options)?Futures and options are financial derivatives that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of an underlying asset without actually owning it. Futures contracts obligate the buyer to purchase an underlying asset, while the seller must deliver it at a predetermined price and date. In options contracts, the buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price and date, while the seller must honour the contract if the buyer chooses to exercise their option.Futures and options trading can be complex and involve significant risk. The value of these derivatives can be affected by various factors, including market volatility, changes in interest rates, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Traders may face substantial losses if their positions move against them.The concepts related to derivatives are vast and have many nuances.

Title: Why were funds deducted from Zerodha account for exiting a profitable short options position?
Content: Why were funds deducted from Zerodha account for exiting a profitable short options position?The amount required to exit a profitable short options position is deducted from the premium received. It can also be seen on the fund's tab on the day when the options are shorted inOptions premiumcolumn.The current market price of an option contract is called a premium. The option buyer pays the premium, whereas the option seller (option writer) receives the premium. There are two things an option writer can do after selling or shorting an option contract:Exit the position by buying back the contract.If the option writer exits the position by buying back the contract, the difference between the premium received and the price at which the option is bought back is the profit or loss.Example scenarioMr X is an option writer and sold RELIANCE SEP 2800 CE on Monday when the premium was ₹42 with 250 as the lot size.Mr X received ₹42 * 250 = ₹10,500 in the trading account.Mr X exited the short position on Wednesday when the premium went down to ₹25 and made a profit of  ₹4250 [(₹42 - ₹25) * 250] by buying back the contract.Since Mr X already received a premium of ₹10,500 when the options were sold, ₹6250 (₹10,500 - ₹4,250) will be deducted from the funds when the position is exited (bought back).Since the option was bought back when it was at ₹25, even though Mr X was in profit, ₹6250 was deducted from the premium received, earning a profit of ₹4250. The margin blocked for shorting the options will be released once the short position is bought back.Hold the position till expiry.If the option writer holds the position till the premium gets 0, i.e. till the expiry, they get to keep the entire premium received as a profit. However, this only happens when the position expires OTM. If the position expires ITM, then the stock options will be physically settled, whereas the index options will be cash settled. To learn more, seeWhat is Zerodha's policy on the physical settlement of equity derivatives on expiry?From the above example, Mr X will only get to keep ₹10,500 entirely as profits if the premium becomes 0, and that will only happen if the position expires OTM.Stock options: If the position expires ITM, then the option writer needs to do one of two things:Give delivery: The option writer needs to give delivery of the stock if a call option expires ITM. However, if the option writer doesn’t have the stocks in the demat account to give the delivery of the stock, there will be a short delivery, and the seller will have to pay the short delivery penalty. To learn more, visitzerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/consequences-of-short-delivery-nse-bse.Take delivery: The option writer needs to take delivery of the stock if it’s a put option. However, if the option writer doesn’t have the funds in the trading account to take delivery of the stock, then there will be a debit balance in the Zerodha account.Index options: If the position expires ITM, then the index options will be cash-settled, and the remaining amount will be debited or credited to the trading account after the trade process for the day.To learn more about option premium calculation for multiple trades, seeHow is Option Premium calculated when there are multiple trades?Related articlesWhy is the option contract or option chain LTP on Kite different from NSE?Why is the withdrawable balance negative?Why are there restrictions on placing Bank Nifty and Nifty option orders for certain strike prices?What changes due to the new upfront margin requirements?Why should a stoploss be set using GTT when buying stock or index options?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is the option order being rejected with a request to place it around the theoretical price?
Content: Why is the option order being rejected with a request to place it around the theoretical price?Brokers are required by the exchanges(PDF)to have risk management checks that ensure freak trades in options don’t occur at prices significantly away from the theoretical prices. These trades are sometimes also referred to as freak trades.Example scenarioAssume a stock trades at ₹95 and the Call option of the 100 Strike trades at ₹5. If there were a buy trade at ₹50 while the stock still trades at ₹95, this trade would be away from the theoretical price.Such freak trades disrupt price discovery, and traders also incur huge losses.These freak trades can either be:AccidentalTraders sometimes can unwittingly place large orders than intended.IntentionalFraudulent actors with access to someone’s trading account can move money from one account to another by creating artificial losses. They do this by buying an illiquid option contract much higher than the theoretical price and reversing the trade at a lower price.To ensure that Zerodha’s customers are protected from these freak trades, placing orders in an option contract is allowed only within a range from the theoretical price of the contract. Zerodha also doesn’t allow market orders in illiquid index options and stock option contracts. Exchanges have stopped supporting Stop Loss Market [SL-M] orders for option contracts for the same reason.Ensure that orders aren’t mistakenly placed in the wrong option contract and are placed closer to the theoretical price if this error is displayed.Did you know?An order can still be placed outside the theoretical range set by Zerodha using a long-standing order type called Good Till Triggered (GTT). But when the GTT is triggered, the above theoretical range checks will be applied, and the order will be rejected if it is outside the range.

Content: What are the risks of trading Futures and Options (F&O)?Futures and options (F&O) are complex and leveraged financial instruments that can lead to permanent loss of capital if traded without understanding the risks.Common risks of F&O trading include:F&O orders can be executed partially or with significant price differences due to liquidity and market volatility.Due to a large difference in the buying and the selling price, orders can be executed at prices far from the Last Traded Price (LTP), increasing impact costs. Here’s an example:The contract above is illiquid. Placing a market buy order for 100 shares based on the LTP will result in the order being executed at the price of ₹19.85.

Title: Why can't market orders be placed for certain index and stock option contracts at Zerodha?
Content: Why can't market orders be placed for certain index and stock option contracts at Zerodha?Market orders are restricted for certain contracts due to liquidity concerns. Illiquid contracts may have bid/ask prices that differ significantly from the last traded or theoretical prices. Placing market orders without considering these bids/asks can lead to unfavourable trade execution and potential losses.To address this, market orders are blocked for illiquid index options and all stock options.  Additionally, SL-M orders are blocked for all Index option derivative contracts as they are discontinued by the exchanges. For FinNifty, MidCPNifty and Sensex, market orders are only permitted for option contracts with an Open Interest (OI) of over 500 lots or 20,000 quantities.Market orders can be placed for two weekly and two monthly contracts (current and near) for Nifty and Bank Nifty options. However, market orders are blocked for weekly expiries other than the current and next week, monthly expiries other than the current and next month, and deep ITM (in the money) contracts exceeding 5%.A market order is an instruction to buy the specified quantity of a scrip irrespective of its available price. In the case of illiquid contracts, the bid/ask price could be at a price far from the last traded price or the theoretical price of the contracts. Customers have placed market orders without checking bids/asks on such contracts and losing money due to trade execution at arbitrary prices. Market orders are hence blocked for illiquid index options and all stock options.A market order in After Market Orders (AMOs) is blocked for monthly index options. However, limit orders can be placed at or above the best bid/ask price to execute trades instantly, similar to a market order.Related articlesHow do I add Nifty and Banknifty Options to my market watch?How to add instruments to the marketwatch?How do I add Futures and Options (F&O) contracts to Marketwatch?How to trade weekly currency options at Zerodha?How to use basket orders to buy options outside the Nifty or Bank Nifty range?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is periodic call auction and why are some stocks traded in this category?
Content: What is periodic call auction and why are some stocks traded in this category?SEBI introduced the concept of Periodic call auctions(PDF)in 2013 as a measure to reduce volatility in illiquid stocks. Stocks that meet specific criteria of illiquidity, as outlined in the SEBI circular, such as having an average daily number of trades of less than 50 and a daily trading volume of less than 10,000, among other conditions, are included in this category.Under the Periodic Call Auction mechanism, six auction sessions are held throughout the trading day, each lasting for one hour. These sessions commence at 9:30 AM and operate similarly to the pre-market session conducted for equity stocks. During the 45-minute window, participants can place, modify, and cancel their orders. All orders received are then matched within the next eight minutes, and the resulting trades are confirmed. A seven-minute buffer period is provided before the next call auction session starts.The implementation of Periodic call auctions allows for a more structured and controlled trading environment for illiquid stocks, ensuring fair price discovery and reducing excessive volatility.Session NoStart Time- Order PlacementOrder matchingBuffer period109:30 AM - 10:15 AM10:15 AM - 10:23 AM10:24 AM to 10:30 AM210:30 AM - 11:15 AM11:15 AM - 11:23 AM11:24 AM to 11:30 AM311:30 AM - 12:15 PM12:15 PM - 12:23 PM12:24 PM to 12:30 PM412:30 PM - 01:15 PM01:15 PM - 1:23 PM01:24 PM to 01:30 PM501:30 PM - 02:15 PM02:15 PM - 2:23 PM02:24 PM to 02:30 PM602:30 PM - 03:15 PM03:15 PM - 3:23 PM03:24 PM to 03:30 PMIf the idea is to buy or sell such illiquid stocks, which are on periodic call auctions, the orders must be placed in the first 45 minutes, and the client will be able to buy or sell based on whether the order matches in the next 8 minutes.

Title: What is devolvement for commodity option and how does it work?
Content: What is devolvement for commodity option and how does it work?Devolvement refers to the conversion of an option contract into a futures contract of the same underlying. When commodity options are In the Money (ITM), they are devolved into the underlying futures contract. The strike price of the devolved options contract is the buy average for take delivery or the sell average for give delivery of the futures contract.  If the option is ITM and there aren't sufficient margins in the Zerodha account to hold till expiry, then the position will be squared off after 9 PM on the expiry day. If there are sufficient margins in the trading account and an ITM option contract is held, it will be devolved into the underlying futures contract from the very next day of expiry.On the options contract expiry date, all open ITM options contracts will be devolved into futures. The exchange blocks a margin equivalent to 25% of the futures margin required to hold the ITM option contract 2 days before expiry and 50% of the futures margin 1 day before expiry, and 100% of the futures margin for devolvement. Failing to produce the margin in the trading account can result in a square-off of open positions at Zerodha’s discretion. If the ITM options trade cannot be matched with a counterparty, it will be cash-settled.Example ScenarioGold is at 31500 levels.GOLD 19JAN 31000 CE is an ITM option contract.On expiry day, GOLD 19JAN 31000 CE will devolve into GOLD 19FEB FUT, with a buy average of 31000.Short position settlement happens based on the counter buyer consent. If a client has open hedge positions on expiry day, it may result in a net-off. In such an event, these positions won’t be carried forward. If Long futures and short call option positions are held, the short call option will be devolved into a short future position after 11:30 pm on the expiry day. In such a case, the positions will be netted off, and these won’t be carried forward.Related articlesWhat does the devolvement of ITM commodity options mean, and what impact does it have on the positions?How are MCX contracts settled?Can NSE/BSE commodities be traded at Zerodha?How to activate commodity (MCX) trading in the Zerodha account?What are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Content: What are large cap, mid cap and small cap companies, and how to identify them?Before October 2017, the categorisation of companies into large cap, mid cap, and small cap was not clearly defined by SEBI.

Market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the market price of each share.  For example, if a company has 5,00,000 shares trading at ₹500 each, its market cap is ₹25 crores (5,00,000 shares x ₹500).Companies are categorised as large, mid, or small cap in order of ranking based on their total market cap, as shown below:Categorisation in terms of market capType of companyTop 100 companiesLarge capCompanies ranking from 101 to 250Mid capCompanies ranked from the 251st position onwardSmall capTo identify a large cap, mid cap or small cap company on Kite, follow these steps:Kite appTap on the stock.Scroll down and tap onFundamentals.The type of company is mentioned beside the company name.Kite webHover over the stock and click on ⋯Click onFundamentals.To know company rankings based on their market cap, visitamfiindia.com/research-information/other-data/categorization-of-stocks.The list is updated every six months using data from the end of June and December of each year.To know company rankings based on their market cap on a day to day basis, visittickertape.in/screener/equity?allscreen=true.Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Content: How are shares settled in a BTST transaction?In a Buy Today Sell Tomorrow (BTST) transaction, shares can be sold before they are delivered to the demat account. To learn more, seeWhat is BTST and how does it work?These transactions are settled by first crediting shares to the client’s account on the day they are received from the Clearing Corporation (CC) and earmarking them for delivery on the same day against the sale of the stock that has already been carried out.Example Scenario100 shares of Reliance were bought on Monday and sold on Tuesday.As per the T+1 settlement cycle for the purchase, the shares are transferred to the demat account on Tuesday.On Tuesday, Zerodha will earmark the 100 shares of Reliance against the sale made on Tuesday.These shares will be debited from the client’s account towards the settlement on Wednesday (T+1 from the sale made on Tuesday).By transferring the shares to the client’s account, subsequently earmarking and debiting for sale settlement, clients will be assured of getting credit for all corporate actions directly in their name. Similarly, if any TDS was deducted for dividends, the same would be filed against their PAN and reflected in their 26AS instead of being passed on from the broker's PAN.Since the shares are credited to their demat account and then debited for BTST transactions, DP charges will apply just like normal delivery transactions.

Title: When does cash settlement happen to close out short delivery?
Content: When does cash settlement happen to close out short delivery?For a video walkthrough on auction markets and how to participate in them, seeWhat are auction markets and how to easily participate in them on Zerodha?Cash settlement to the trading account usually happens on T+2 day if the exchange is unable to obtain the shares in the auction. The probability of cash settlement is lower for liquid stocks and higher for illiquid stocks. To learn more about short delivery, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?Did you know?The price at which the transaction is settled to the trading account, known as the close-out price, is generally over 20% higher than the stock's closing price on auction day. This amount can be used to purchase the stocks again once the cash has been credited to the trading account.Example scenario100 shares of Oriental Trimex are bought at ₹15 per share, which are short-delivered.The exchange tries to find sellers who can deliver 100 shares of Oriental Trimex in the auction market to deliver to the client’s demat account.The trade gets cash settled if there are no sellers in the auction market.If the closing price of Oriental Trimex on the auction date was ₹18, the exchange cash settles the trade at ₹21.6 (20% higher than 18).The seller who defaulted pays ₹2160 (21.6 * 100 shares), and the buyer receives ₹2160.If the price of Oriental Trimex reaches ₹25 from the day of trading till the auction day, then the cash settlement is done at ₹25 instead of ₹21.6.This is because cash settlement always happens at whichever is higher of the following:The closing price on auction day + 20%.The highest price of the stock from trading day till the auction date.In the event of short delivery of AAA and above-rated bonds or debentures, the closing price will be the greater of the highest exchange rate from the start of the trading period to the close-out day, or 5% above the auction day's official closing price. For bonds and debentures rated below AAA, a 20% close-out markup is applied.To learn more, seezerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/consequences-of-short-delivery-nse-bse.Related articlesWhat are auction markets and how to participate in them on Kite?Why has the fund balance increased but shares are missing from holdings?What is short delivery and what are its consequences?Why are the purchased shares not visible in the holdings?Why are clients unable to sell their pledged holdings in the post-market session and in the auction market?Still need help?Create a ticket

Title: What is short delivery and what are its consequences?
Content: What is short delivery and what are its consequences?For a video walkthrough on auction markets and how to participate in them, seeWhat are auction markets and how to easily participate in them on Zerodha?When the seller of a stock fails to deliver the shares to the exchange for the buyer's demat account, it is known as short delivery. This generally occurs when intraday short positions cannot be closed because of illiquidity or stocks hitting the upper circuit. To learn more about circuit limits, seeWhat are circuit limits or price bands?The consequences of short delivery are different for the buyer and the seller and are as follows:BuyerHow to know if the shares have been short-delivered?Buyers are notified through email and a Kite notification when a short delivery happens. A short-delivery tag is also displayed beside the short-delivered stock.Kite appThe short-delivered quantity is displayed for the stock.Kite webHovering over the tag displays the short-delivered quantity.When will the shares be credited after a short delivery?The shares will be credited to the buyer’s demat account on T+2 day after the exchange holds an auction on T+1 day to procure the short-delivered shares. If the exchange cannot procure the shares in the auction, the Zerodha account will be credited with cash based on the close-out price. See,When does cash settlement happen to close out short delivery?Example ScenarioShares are purchased on Monday (T day) and are tagged as T1 holdings until Tuesday (T+1 day).If the shares were not delivered on Tuesday (T+1 day), a short delivery tag is applied to the stock on Wednesday (T+2 day).The exchange delivers the shares procured from the auction market held on Tuesday (T+1 day) and delivers them on Wednesday (T+2 day). The shares will be visible on Kite from Thursday (T+3 day).SellerWhat happens when the seller defaults?The exchange conducts an auction to deliver the short quantities from other sellers. For shares sold on Monday, the auction happens on Tuesday, with the closing price of Monday used to determine the auction price. The price range of the auction is capped at 20% at the upper and lower end.The exchange delivers the shares to the buyer’s demat at the auction price on Wednesday, and the defaulting seller is sent an auction note and is obligated to pay an auction penalty to the exchange.Example scenario100 shares are sold on Monday (T day) at ₹800 per share. The stock hits the upper circuit, and there are no sellers.The exchange conducts an auction on Tuesday (T+1 day) and uses the closing price of Monday (T day) to determine the auction price. If the closing price were ₹830, the auction price range would be ₹664 to ₹996, i.e. 20% upper and lower of the closing price.If the auction price were ₹920, on Wednesday (T+2 day) the seller would have to pay ₹12,000 [(₹920 - ₹800)*100].Did you know?If the auction price is lesser than the closing price on T day, the higher price is used to calculate the auction penalty, and the difference between the auction price and the closing price is transferred to the investor protection fund.Related articlesWhy has the fund balance increased but shares are missing from holdings?Why are the purchased shares not visible in the holdings?What is BTST and how does it work?What are the risks involved in BTST?What are auction markets and how to participate in them on Kite?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are circuit limits or price bands?
Content: What are circuit limits or price bands?Circuit limits, or price bands, are safeguards set by the exchange to prevent large movements in the price of stocks in a very short time. When the price of an instrument hits the upper or lower circuit limit set by the exchange, orders will remain pending at that circuit price for that particular stock or contract( EQ, FNO, CDS or MCX).The price band determines the price range within which the stock can be traded for that day. The circuit limits, which range from 2 to 20%, depend on the liquidity, volume, and category of the stocks. The upper and lower circuit for a particular instrument can be found in the market depth on Kite.Orders placed out of the price band will be rejected, and if the price drops to the upper or lower price band, the orders will remain pending till the limits are relaxed. To know what happens when the MIS position and circuit limits are hit, seeWhat will happen to my intraday (MIS/CO) position in case the stock circuit limits are hit?Did you know?Equities with Futures & Options (F&O) contracts don't have fixed circuit limits for the day. However, there is a dynamic price band of 10%. The exchange has a fixed operating range of 10% on either side to ensure trading is done within the specified range. When the price approaches these levels, the limits are relaxed further. There is currently a cooling period of 15 minutes before new limits are added for F&O stocks.Related articlesWhy is the order pending on Kite?Why is the circuit limit showing differently on Kite after the stocks circuit limit has already been hit?What are market-wide circuit breakers?What is short delivery and what are its consequences?What will happen to my intraday (MIS/CO) position in case the stock circuit limits are hit?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why have I been charged margin penalty?
Content: What is a margin penalty, and why is it charged?A margin penalty is a charge imposed for failing to maintain sufficient margin in a trading account. Clients are required by exchanges to maintain adequate margins for their trades and to transfer funds in the event of a margin shortfall, which means a deficit of funds or margin in the trading account.There are two types of margin penalties:1. Upfront margin penaltyUpfront margin refers to the margin that must be provided in order to initiate a trade. The broker will be charged an upfront margin penalty if the trader doesn't have sufficient margin in their account when entering a trade.Example scenarioIf the broker lets a trader enter a position with a minimum margin of ₹1.1 lakh (SPAN + Exposure), but the trader only has ₹1 lakh in their account, there will be a shortfall of ₹10,000, resulting in a penalty being imposed on that amount.2. Non-upfront margin penaltyNon-upfront margin pertains to the margins that should be fulfilled by the client after initiating a trade, following the fulfilment of the upfront margin requirement. If the client fails to provide the required funds within the deadline, it leads to a deficit and may result in a penalty. If there are marked-to-market (MTM) losses in futures contracts, the client has until T+1 day till 11.59 PM to add the funds. Failure to do so is considered a non-upfront margin deficit and can lead to a penalty. Additionally, ad-hoc margin requirements added by exchanges owing to volatility or physical delivery margins to stock F&O contracts in the last week of expiry are also deemed non-upfront margins. If a penalty is charged for non-upfront margins, the corresponding fund statement entry will be posted on the T+6th day, as margin reporting is due on T+5 days.Visittradingqna.com/t/nse-circular-on-short-margin-penalty-refund/136203/26for more detailed examples of upfront and non-upfront margin penalties.Related articlesWhat are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?What is Value at Risk (VAR), Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), and Adhoc margins?What is a daily margin statement, and how to understand it?Will brokerage and taxes be considered when margins are blocked for trades in the commodity segment?How to place basket orders on Kite?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Content: Why is there no price movement in the stock’s option contracts when the price of the stock and its futures contract is moving?The price movement only occurs if there is trading activity in a stock or a contract. If there is no price movement for the options contract even though the underlying stock and future contract are moving, it means that the option contract is not actively traded. The trading activity of any instrument can be checked by seeing the Last Traded Time (LTT). The LTT displays the time when a particular share or contract was last bought or sold.To see the LTT of any instrument, open the market depth of an instrument.There might be fluctuation in the bid and offer or chart of an instrument even though it’s not traded due to the following reasons:Bid and offer:The bid and the offer prices could be moving, but the Last Traded Price (LTP) would not have moved at all. This is because the top 5 bid and ask prices are displayed in the market depth window at all times by default, even if there is no trading activity in the instrument.Charts:The charts generally show dashes for a particular option contract until trades happen, after which the candles are formed.

Title: Why is MIS not allowed for certain instruments?
Content: Why are intraday (MIS/CO) orders not allowed for some stocks?Intraday (MIS/CO) orders are not allowed for some stocks due to regulatory or risk management reasons. These types of orders provide leverage, allowing traders to trade with more funds than they have in their Zerodha account. However, stockbrokers may restrict intraday orders for certain stocks to mitigate potential risks. In such cases, traders can only place delivery (CNC) orders for those particular stocks. To learn more about product types, seeWhat does CNC, MIS and NRML mean?Intraday orders may be blocked due to the high risk of being unable to exit the intraday position, which can potentially lead to short delivery in certain situations. To learn more about short delivery, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?There are several reasons why intraday orders can be blocked, including:Volatile markets or sudden movements:During periods of high volatility, specific intraday order types (MIS/CO) may be blocked to prevent clients from incurring losses beyond their available account funds and to mitigate credit risk for the broker.Low liquidity or volume:If a stock has low liquidity or trading volume, intraday orders may be blocked to ensure that there is sufficient market depth for smooth order execution.Small circuit limit range:Intraday orders can be blocked for stocks with a small circuit limit range to avoid excessive price fluctuations and potential market manipulation. To learn more about circuit limits, seeWhat are circuit limits or price bands?IPO listing day:On the day of an initial public offering (IPO) listing, when market volatility is typically high, intraday orders may be blocked to manage risk and protect investors.High margin requirement and potential margin penalty:Stocks with high margin requirements may have intraday trading blocked to avoid margin penalties that may be incurred due to inadequate margin coverage. To learn more about margin penalty, seeWhat is a margin penalty, and why is it charged?Regulatory restrictions:Stocks categorized as Trade-to-Trade(WEB),ASM (Additional Surveillance Measures)(WEB),GSM (Graded Surveillance Measures)(WEB),or Unsolicited SMS category are blocked from intraday trading due to regulatory restrictions.Intraday orders can be blocked for any instrument based on Zerodha's policy.

Title: Why is the account in debit after placing a stop-loss order?
Content: Why is the account in debit after placing a stop-loss order?The reason for the debit in the account after placing the SL (Stop Loss) could be due to a hedged position. Hedging is a strategy used to safeguard trading positions from potential losses in case of unfavourable market movements.A margin benefit is provided for hedged positions, which reduces the funds required for trading. To learn more about hedging, visitzerodha.com/varsity/chapter/hedging-futures.Consider a scenario where two open positions are hedged against each other. Placing a SL order for one of the positions eliminates the hedge, treating both positions as separate open positions. Consequently, the margin requirement for these two positions increases immediately. If sufficient funds are not available in the account to cover the margin for an unhedged position, an SMS and email will be sent regarding the margin shortfall. Adding funds to the account can prevent automatic square off (closing/exiting) of the position.Alternatively, monitoring the hedged position manually and exiting when necessary can be an alternative to placing a SL order. To retain the margin benefit on hedged positions, it is possible to use a GTT (Good Till Triggered) order instead of a Stop Loss order. To learn more about GTT, seeHow to use the Good Till Triggered (GTT) feature?Example ScenarioIf a long Nifty position is hedged with a short call position, ₹1,62,000 will be blocked in the trading account, considering the hedging margin benefit.Placing a Stop Loss order for Nifty May 15000 CE removes the hedge and results in the loss of the margin benefit. As a result, the complete margin of ₹2,94,315 will be blocked in the trading account.Insufficient funds in the account will trigger SMS and email notifications for a margin call.Opting to place a GTT order instead of a Stop Loss order will maintain the blocked funds at ₹1,62,000, ensuring the retention of the margin benefit.Related articlesBy when should additional margins be added if a margin call is received?Why was an email and voice message received for the provisional margin shortfall?Why is the entire margin required to enter into a hedged position?Why should clients transfer funds to cover margin shortfalls?What does the 'delivery margin' field on Zerodha Kite mean?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why isn't the order getting executed even though it has been placed successfully?
Content: Why isn't the order getting executed even though it has been placed successfully?Due to certain circumstances, the order may not be executed despite being successfully placed. In situations where there is extremely negative news about the company, stock prices can rapidly decline. Consequently, the stock continuously hits lower circuit limits on a daily basis, resulting in a lack of new buyers willing to purchase these shares. This occurrence is commonly observed in penny stocks that lack liquidity. To learn more about circuit limits, seeWhat are circuit limits or price bands?Similarly, when there is significant buying pressure and demand for a particular stock, there can be numerous bids but a shortage of sellers willing to trade these shares. As a result, the execution of the order may be delayed or prevented altogether.When placing an order during normal market hours, order matching on the exchange follows a price-time priority system. This means orders are executed on a "first come, first serve" basis, similar to a queue system. If other individuals have placed prior orders, the order will only be executed once those preceding orders are filled.To potentially move ahead in the queue, there are a few options available:Place an After Market Order (AMO) - This can be a Limit or Market order, and it is advisable to do so after 3:45 PM. Market orders generally have a higher chance of being filled. To learn more about AMO, seeWhat is an AMO and how to place it?Place a market or limit order during the pre-market session, which begins at 9:00 AM. To learn more about pre-market sessions, seeWhat are pre-market and post-market sessions and orders in NSE and BSE?Placing a pre-market order typically has a better chance of being executed compared to an AMO. However, choosing an AMO offers more convenience as it allows orders to be placed anytime between 3:45 PM to 8:57 AM for NSE and 3:45 PM to 8:59 AM for BSE without waiting for the pre-market timings.Did you know?Despite placing an AMO or pre-market order, there is no assurance that the order will be executed. This applies universally to all brokers.Related articlesWhy is the order pending on Kite?Why was the limit order executed at the market price instead of the specified limit price?What will happen to my intraday (MIS/CO) position in case the stock circuit limits are hit?Why is the circuit limit showing differently on Kite after the stocks circuit limit has already been hit?Why is a nudge displayed saying that the order price is x% above or below the Last Traded Price (LTP)?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are Exchange Traded Funds(ETF’s)?
Content: What are Exchange Traded Funds(ETF’s)?An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock.

Title: What are Differential Voting Rights (DVR) shares?
Content: What are Differential Voting Rights (DVR) shares?Differential Voting Rights (DVRs) shares provide shareholders with either higher or lower voting rights in comparison to ordinary shareholders of the company. When a shareholder has higher voting rights in a ratio of 10:1, it means they have 10 votes per share held. Conversely, lower voting rights in a ratio of 1:10 means having 1 vote for every 10 shares held.However, Indian regulations prohibit companies from issuing equity shares with higher voting rights. As a result, the DVR shares available in the market typically have limited voting rights. These shares are traded on the stock exchange similar to ordinary shares but often at a discounted price and with a higher dividend.Example ScenarioA Tata Motor DVR has 10% voting rights compared to an ordinary Tata Motor share.Tata MotorsTata Motors DVRVoting Rights1:1 (1 voting right per share.)1:10 (1 voting right for every 10 shares held.)Dividend payoutLower dividend than Tata Motors DVR5% more dividend than Tata MotorsReasons for issuing DVRsPrevention of hostile takeover:Since DVRs are issued with limited voting rights, they do not dilute the promoters voting rights and make it difficult for hostile takeovers.Bring in Passive/Retail investors:Passive/Retail investors may not want to indulge in the managerial operations of a business in which they are investing. In most cases, such investors are looking only to make profits. DVR shares are ideal as investors can focus on the dividend generation aspect, without needing to deal with the decision-making aspect of the company. DVR shares are offered at a discount compared to ordinary shares because of the lower voting rights. In turn, investors can acquire more shares at a lower price, thus increasing their dividend earning potential.Related articlesWhat is a Right Entitlement?What happens if I buy/receive REs but don't apply for rights shares?Rights Issues and Rights Entitlements (RE) - FAQsWhat is Demat Debit and Pledge Instruction (DDPI)?××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why has the fund balance increased but shares are missing from holdings?
Content: Why has the fund balance increased but shares are missing from holdings?Shares may not appear in the holdings after they are purchased if they are short-delivered. To learn more about short delivery, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?In such a scenario, there are two possible outcomes. Firstly, on the T+2 day, the individual may receive the shares that were previously short-delivered. Alternatively, if the exchange is unable to acquire the shares on behalf of the individual, the transaction may be settled in cash. In this case, the exchange settles the transaction by providing a cash credit based on the close-out rate. The close-out rate is determined as the higher of the stock's highest price from the time of sale to the auction day or 20% above the closing price on the auction day (T+1).

Title: What are partly paid shares?
Content: What are partly paid shares?A partly paid share refers to a share in a company that has been paid for partially, instead of paying the full issue price upfront. This allows investors to acquire these shares without making the complete payment at the beginning. The remaining amount for partly paid shares can be paid in instalments when the company issues a call for payment.Suppose we have a company with a stock price of ₹100. An investor decides to buy a share for ₹75. Sometime later, the company might ask the shareholder to pay the outstanding balance of ₹25 (or make an instalment payment). When you invest in partly paid shares, keep in mind that the company may request additional funds from time to time until the shares are completely paid off.Now, let's address a few common questions that may arise regarding partly paid shares.Q. Is it possible to sell partly paid shares before the call date?A. Yes, investors have the option to sell partly paid shares before the call date.Q. Are partly paid shares tradable in the market?A. Yes, partly paid shares can be traded in the markets until they are suspended two days before the ex/record date.Q. How and when are call payments made for partly paid shares?A. The Registrar & Transfer Agent (RTA) of the company will provide a website link for the payment of call money. All communication from the RTA will be sent to the email ID associated with the Zerodha account. Payments for the call money should be made from the shareholders' bank account, as payments from third-party accounts are not eligible.Q. What are the consequences of not making the call payment?A. There are several potential outcomes if the call money is not paid. Firstly, currently held partly paid shares may be forfeited by the company. As a result, these shares would become worthless and would not be tradable on exchanges. The company may then proceed to issue new partly-paid shares under a different ISIN (International Security Identification Number).Additionally, the company may impose interest on the unpaid amount. The specific interest rate would depend on the number of partly paid shares held.What happens after paying the first call to the company?The company will allocate new partly-paid shares to clients under a new ISIN (International Security Identification Number), which will be fully paid up to the amount they have already paid (including initial application money and the first call money). Once the first call payment is collected, these newly allotted partly-paid shares will be listed again, enabling clients to trade them. These shares will be visible under the new ISIN in the Zerodha Kite holding.Related articlesWhat is the correct buy average for the partly-paid shares?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are the risks involved in BTST?
Content: What are the risks involved in BTST?BTST (Buy Today Sell Tomorrow) - Trades where the shares are bought and sold on the next trading day, i.e. T+1 day.The risk with BTST trades is that since the clients are selling shares that aren't in their demat account yet, they rely on the seller they’ve bought the shares from to give them the stock. If the seller defaults on giving them the shares, i.e. in the event of short delivery, the client’s obligation as a seller to deliver shares won't be met, and the clients will face the risk of auction penalty, which can be up to 20% of the value of stock short delivered.

Title: Why is there a difference between the LTP and closing price on NSE?
Content: Why is there a difference between the LTP and closing price on NSE?The reason for the difference between the closing price on the NSE and the last traded price (LTP) is that the LTP represents the actual last traded price, while the NSE's closing price is calculated as a weighted average of the last 30 minutes of trading. As a result, the closing price on the daily charts also does not match the LTP since it is updated using the NSE Bhavcopy's closing price.Related articlesWhy does the Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) of historical data on the Kite charts sometimes not match the records updated in NSE or BSE?Why do the colour on bar charts and volume bars not match sometimes?How are the pivot points derived while using the Central Pivot Range (CPR)?How to close the Zerodha account?Why does the LTP under holdings not match with the Marketwatch?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is a daily margin statement, and how to understand it?
Content: What is a daily margin statement, and how to understand it?A daily margin statement is a report that provides clients with information regarding their margins. It includes information on deposited margins, such as fund transfers and pledged collaterals, as well as blocked margins for held or taken positions. The report aims to inform clients of the following:Margin required by the exchanges for the positions taken or held.Availability of free margins in the account to take new positions.Margin shortfall in the account so that the clients can maintain adequate funds to avoid any margin penalty. To learn more, seeWhat are margins and how can margin shortfall occur?The daily margin statement is sent to the registered email address on the days when the client has traded. Alternatively, it can also be downloaded by visitingconsole.zerodha.com/reports/downloads.Understanding the Daily margin statementMargin AvailableTheMargin Availablesection provides details of cash balance, margin received from pledging shares (collateral margin) and value of shares sold from the demat account, which can be considered towards the margin, also referred to as Early Payin(EPI) margin.Here’s a detailed explanation of the four columns in this section:Funds - Annex A: This column shows the fund balance after reversing the effect of T-day credits and debits of the Equity, F&O and CDS (Currency derivative) segments. Reversing means deducting the unsettled credit obligation and adding back the unsettled debit obligation because it takes T+1 day for Equity, F&O and CDS amounts to get settled. Let’s understand this with an example.Example ScenarioMr A has a fund balance of ₹1,00,000 on Tuesday. He bought options worth ₹30,000 and Reliance shares worth ₹20,000 and sold TataMotors worth ₹30,000 on Tuesday. His closing balance on Tuesday is ₹80,000. The calculation of the fund balance is as follows:Tuesday’s (T-Day) closing balance80,000ADD: Unsettled debitsSum of options and shares bought on Tuesday (T Day)50,000LESS: Unsettled creditsShares sold on Tuesday ( T Day)30,000Unencumbered Balance (Fund balance)Funds available on Tuesday (T Day)1,00,000The settlement cycle for all instruments is T+1 Day. Hence the unsettled credits and debits for all the segments are reversed for T day. To learn more, seeWhat does settlement cycle mean?The detailed breakdown of this calculation is explained in Annex A.Value of Securities - Annex B: This column shows the collateral margins. Collateral margins are the margins received from pledging the stocks after the applicable haircut. Annex B explains the break up of securities pledged. To learn more, seeWhat does Collateral(Equity) in the ‘funds’ mean?Any other approved form of Margins (EPI) - Annex C: Shares sold from the client's demat account are transferred to the exchange’s account on the Trade day. Sale value from such sold securities is considered as the available margin towards the subsequent margin requirement of the client. Early Pay-in(EPI) value is calculated by taking 80% of T Day sell value.Margin RequiredTheMargin requiredsection indicates the exchange mandated margins to initiate the trades in respective segments.Here’s a detailed explanation of the five columns in this section:Upfront Margin required: This column shows the upfront margins. Upfront margin is the minimum amount required to take a trade and is to be collected on an upfront basis on trade day. Upfront margins for each segment are as follows:EQ = Minimum margin + Additional marginF&O = Span Margin + Extreme Loss MarginCDS = Span Margin + Extreme Loss MarginMCX = Span MarginTo learn more, seeWhat is SPAN and exposure margin?andWhat is Value at Risk (VAR), Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), and Adhoc margins?Consolidated Crystallised Obligation: This column shows the sum of MTM loss margin or option premium payable in the respective segment. It shows the due or non-upfront margins, which means that they can be collected till T+1 day.In the case of MCX, Consolidated crystalised obligation margin is referred as MTM margin. To learn more, seeWhat is Mark to Market (MTM)?Delivery Margin required: This column shows the physical delivery margins charged by the exchange for In The Money (ITM) options held till expiry. Exchange levies physical delivery margins as a percentage of applicable margins (VAR + ELM + Adhoc) of the underlying stock, which is levied from expiry minus four days. To learn more, seeWhat is Zerodha's policy on the physical settlement of equity derivatives on expiry?Total End of the day (EOD) Margin required: This column shows the total amount blocked by the exchange for the position, segment-wise.

Title: Why is the opening price of a stock different from its previous day's closing price on Kite?
Content: Why is the opening price of a stock different from its previous day's closing price on Kite?Let us first understand the meaning of the closing and opening prices and how they are calculated for a stock.Closing PriceThe closing price is a stock's trading price at the end of a trading day. This makes it the most recent price of a stock until the next trading session. For equities, the market timing is from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM. In the case of equity, the closing price is calculated as the weighted average price of the last 30 minutes, i.e., from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM.Example scenarioThe closing price is ₹51.48, which is different from the last traded price at 3:30 PM, i.e., ₹54.To know more about the closing price and how it differs from the Last Traded Price (LTP), visittradingqna.com/t/how-to-determine-closing-price-in-f-o/584.Opening PriceThe opening price is the price at which a stock first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day. For equities, the market timing is from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM. But, the exchange starts collecting orders from 9:00 AM till 9:08 AM, called as pre-market window. During this time, they collect the orders, and 7 minutes before markets open, they match these orders to decide at what price the stock will open for the day at 9:15 AM. To learn more about market timings, seeWhat are the market timings?There's a pre-market window within which the opening price is calculated, and depending upon the demand and supply of a stock, the opening price may differ from its previous day's closing price.In the hours between the closing price and the next trading day's opening price, the price of a particular stock can be affected due to several factors, such as:After market order(AMO):AMO has a major effect on the stock price between the closing and opening price because it means that orders are being placed even after the markets are closed, which results in changing the prices of stocks. To know more about After market orders(AMO), seeWhat is an AMO and when can we place it?News about a company:News about a company can be released while the market is closed, changing what investors are prepared to pay to own a company's share and changing the price of the company's stock without any trades occurring. In most cases, positive news would increase the stock price, whereas negative news would decrease the stock price.Related articlesWhy do the colour on bar charts and volume bars not match sometimes?What are the charges for gifting stocks?Why is there a difference between the LTP and closing price on NSE?What is short delivery and what are its consequences?Why does the P&L on holdings and positions page on Kite change post 3.30 PM?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

To learn more, seeWhat are call and trade (auto square off) charges?However, the onus of squaring off positions is on the client, not the broker. If the client or the broker fails to square off the short position on the same day due to various reasons like stock hitting the upper circuit or lack of liquidity, it may result in short delivery. To learn more, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?Equity FuturesA futures contract can be shorted and can be carried or held overnight, unlike short selling in the equity segment, where the position must be squared off on the same day. To place a sell order for futures contract, MIS (for intraday) or NRML (for overnight) product type can be used to place a sell order. However, If a futures contract is traded using MIS, it must be converted to NRML to carry it overnight or must be squared off before 3:25 PM to avoid auto square-off charges.

Title: What are the risks associated with the physical delivery of stock Futures & Options (F&O)?
Content: What are the risks associated with the physical delivery of stock Futures & Options (F&O)?The physical delivery of stock derivatives can result in potential systemic risk in the Indian capital markets and pose a significant threat to traders. If a customer holds stock futures or in-the-money stock options at the time of expiry, they must give or take delivery of the entire contract's stock value. This increases the risk for clients who do not have enough cash to take delivery or stocks to give delivery. As a result, the margins required to hold a future or short option position increase as the expiry date approaches, with a minimum of 50% of the contract value or 1.5 times NRML margin (whichever is lower).Moreover, even In-The-Money (ITM) long or buy option positions require a delivery margin four days before expiry. The margins for long ITM options increase from 10% of VaR + ELM +  Adhoc margins to 50% of the contract value, with 50% of the contract value required on the last day of expiry. The broker squares off the contract if the customer lacks sufficient funds or stocks to give or take delivery. If the customer shows an intent to hold after the higher margin is blocked, it indicates their intent to give or take delivery.The risk, however, arises from out-of-the-money (OTM) options that suddenly become ITM on the last day of expiry. No additional margins are blocked for OTM options in the expiry week, and if they suddenly become ITM, a customer with small amounts of premium and no margin can get assigned to give or take large delivery positions, posing a significant risk to the trader and the brokerage firm.To learn more about the risks of physical delivery of stock F&O, visitzerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/physical-delivery-of-stock-fo-their-risks.Related articlesWhat are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?Why is higher than usual margin blocked for my F&O trades close to expiry?What is Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) and how to avail it?What does the 'delivery margin' field on Zerodha Kite mean?What are margins and how can margin shortfall occur?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: How is buy average calculated for F&O trades?
Content: How is buy average calculated for F&O trades?If the same contract is traded multiple times, the average price of the positions may change. The buy average for F&O positions is calculated using the FIFO (First In, First Out) method, regardless of the product type used to close the positions (MIS or NRML).Since all trades must use the FIFO method, it's best to use the same method to calculate the P&L when filing income tax returns. Please consult a CA before deviating from the FIFO method used on Kite and Console.Let’s consider the following trades to understand FIFO:DateSymbolTrade TypeQuantityRate (₹)06th AugNIFTY18AUGFUTBuy751100007th AugNIFTY18AUGFUTBuy751110007th AugNIFTY18AUGFUTSell7511050In the above case, the buy trade executed on 06th August will be the open quantity at the end of the day; hence, the average price of the open quantity on 07th August will be ₹11100. This logic does not change regardless of the product type used (NRML/MIS) for the trades on 07th August.The P&L will show a booked profit of ₹3750 [i.e. (11050-11000)*75], and the position will show the difference between the current market price and ₹11100 as the gain/loss for the open position. The same FIFO logic is applicable for both carried forward (NRML) and intra-day (MIS) trades. However, MIS positions can only be exited using MIS product type, and the same goes for NRML. An NRML position cannot be exited using MIS product type and vice versa.Related articlesHow is the buy average calculated in Console?How can multiple trades for shares transferred to the Zerodha account be added?Why is the buy average for some mutual funds shown as a discrepancy?Why has the average price been reduced after receiving bonus shares in Zerodha?How is the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) calculated?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is F&O (Futures and Options)?
Content: What is F&O (Futures and Options)?Futures and options are financial derivatives that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of an underlying asset without actually owning it. Futures contracts obligate the buyer to purchase an underlying asset, while the seller must deliver it at a predetermined price and date. In options contracts, the buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price and date, while the seller must honour the contract if the buyer chooses to exercise their option.Futures and options trading can be complex and involve significant risk. The value of these derivatives can be affected by various factors, including market volatility, changes in interest rates, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Traders may face substantial losses if their positions move against them.The concepts related to derivatives are vast and have many nuances.

Title: Why were funds deducted from Zerodha account for exiting a profitable short options position?
Content: Why were funds deducted from Zerodha account for exiting a profitable short options position?The amount required to exit a profitable short options position is deducted from the premium received. It can also be seen on the fund's tab on the day when the options are shorted inOptions premiumcolumn.The current market price of an option contract is called a premium. The option buyer pays the premium, whereas the option seller (option writer) receives the premium. There are two things an option writer can do after selling or shorting an option contract:Exit the position by buying back the contract.If the option writer exits the position by buying back the contract, the difference between the premium received and the price at which the option is bought back is the profit or loss.Example scenarioMr X is an option writer and sold RELIANCE SEP 2800 CE on Monday when the premium was ₹42 with 250 as the lot size.Mr X received ₹42 * 250 = ₹10,500 in the trading account.Mr X exited the short position on Wednesday when the premium went down to ₹25 and made a profit of  ₹4250 [(₹42 - ₹25) * 250] by buying back the contract.Since Mr X already received a premium of ₹10,500 when the options were sold, ₹6250 (₹10,500 - ₹4,250) will be deducted from the funds when the position is exited (bought back).Since the option was bought back when it was at ₹25, even though Mr X was in profit, ₹6250 was deducted from the premium received, earning a profit of ₹4250. The margin blocked for shorting the options will be released once the short position is bought back.Hold the position till expiry.If the option writer holds the position till the premium gets 0, i.e. till the expiry, they get to keep the entire premium received as a profit. However, this only happens when the position expires OTM. If the position expires ITM, then the stock options will be physically settled, whereas the index options will be cash settled. To learn more, seeWhat is Zerodha's policy on the physical settlement of equity derivatives on expiry?From the above example, Mr X will only get to keep ₹10,500 entirely as profits if the premium becomes 0, and that will only happen if the position expires OTM.Stock options: If the position expires ITM, then the option writer needs to do one of two things:Give delivery: The option writer needs to give delivery of the stock if a call option expires ITM. However, if the option writer doesn’t have the stocks in the demat account to give the delivery of the stock, there will be a short delivery, and the seller will have to pay the short delivery penalty. To learn more, visitzerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/consequences-of-short-delivery-nse-bse.Take delivery: The option writer needs to take delivery of the stock if it’s a put option. However, if the option writer doesn’t have the funds in the trading account to take delivery of the stock, then there will be a debit balance in the Zerodha account.Index options: If the position expires ITM, then the index options will be cash-settled, and the remaining amount will be debited or credited to the trading account after the trade process for the day.To learn more about option premium calculation for multiple trades, seeHow is Option Premium calculated when there are multiple trades?Related articlesWhy is the option contract or option chain LTP on Kite different from NSE?Why is the withdrawable balance negative?Why are there restrictions on placing Bank Nifty and Nifty option orders for certain strike prices?What changes due to the new upfront margin requirements?Why should a stoploss be set using GTT when buying stock or index options?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is the option order being rejected with a request to place it around the theoretical price?
Content: Why is the option order being rejected with a request to place it around the theoretical price?Brokers are required by the exchanges(PDF)to have risk management checks that ensure freak trades in options don’t occur at prices significantly away from the theoretical prices. These trades are sometimes also referred to as freak trades.Example scenarioAssume a stock trades at ₹95 and the Call option of the 100 Strike trades at ₹5. If there were a buy trade at ₹50 while the stock still trades at ₹95, this trade would be away from the theoretical price.Such freak trades disrupt price discovery, and traders also incur huge losses.These freak trades can either be:AccidentalTraders sometimes can unwittingly place large orders than intended.IntentionalFraudulent actors with access to someone’s trading account can move money from one account to another by creating artificial losses. They do this by buying an illiquid option contract much higher than the theoretical price and reversing the trade at a lower price.To ensure that Zerodha’s customers are protected from these freak trades, placing orders in an option contract is allowed only within a range from the theoretical price of the contract. Zerodha also doesn’t allow market orders in illiquid index options and stock option contracts. Exchanges have stopped supporting Stop Loss Market [SL-M] orders for option contracts for the same reason.Ensure that orders aren’t mistakenly placed in the wrong option contract and are placed closer to the theoretical price if this error is displayed.Did you know?An order can still be placed outside the theoretical range set by Zerodha using a long-standing order type called Good Till Triggered (GTT). But when the GTT is triggered, the above theoretical range checks will be applied, and the order will be rejected if it is outside the range.

Title: What does Rollover mean?
Content: What does Rollover mean?Rollover or rolling over a contract means carrying forward the futures position by switching from the current-month contract closer to expiration to another-month contract with expiry in another month. A rollover is done by closing the position in a contract that is about to expire and opening a similar new position in another month's contract. Rollover can only be done for futures and not for options.Example ScenarioA Nifty futures contract is bought with an expiry date of 23rd February.The trader thinks that nifty will continue to go up in March and wants to hold this position till then.Since this position will expire on 23rd February, the trader can exit the Nifty February futures contract and take a new position for March futures contract with an expiry date in March.As per SEBI(ZIP),Rollover of contracts in the ban period is not allowed.

Title: What are the risks of trading Futures and Options (F&O)?
Content: What are the risks of trading Futures and Options (F&O)?Futures and options (F&O) are complex and leveraged financial instruments that can lead to permanent loss of capital if traded without understanding the risks.Common risks of F&O trading include:F&O orders can be executed partially or with significant price differences due to liquidity and market volatility.Due to a large difference in the buying and the selling price, orders can be executed at prices far from the Last Traded Price (LTP), increasing impact costs. Here’s an example:The contract above is illiquid. Placing a market buy order for 100 shares based on the LTP will result in the order being executed at the price of ₹19.85. In this case, the difference of ₹10.8 is the impact cost. Impact costs can be reduced using Iceberg orders.

Title: Why can't market orders be placed for certain index and stock option contracts at Zerodha?
Content: Why can't market orders be placed for certain index and stock option contracts at Zerodha?Market orders are restricted for certain contracts due to liquidity concerns. Illiquid contracts may have bid/ask prices that differ significantly from the last traded or theoretical prices. Placing market orders without considering these bids/asks can lead to unfavourable trade execution and potential losses.To address this, market orders are blocked for illiquid index options and all stock options.  Additionally, SL-M orders are blocked for all Index option derivative contracts as they are discontinued by the exchanges. For FinNifty, MidCPNifty and Sensex, market orders are only permitted for option contracts with an Open Interest (OI) of over 500 lots or 20,000 quantities.Market orders can be placed for two weekly and two monthly contracts (current and near) for Nifty and Bank Nifty options. However, market orders are blocked for weekly expiries other than the current and next week, monthly expiries other than the current and next month, and deep ITM (in the money) contracts exceeding 5%.A market order is an instruction to buy the specified quantity of a scrip irrespective of its available price. In the case of illiquid contracts, the bid/ask price could be at a price far from the last traded price or the theoretical price of the contracts. Customers have placed market orders without checking bids/asks on such contracts and losing money due to trade execution at arbitrary prices. Market orders are hence blocked for illiquid index options and all stock options.A market order in After Market Orders (AMOs) is blocked for monthly index options.

Title: What is periodic call auction and why are some stocks traded in this category?
Content: What is periodic call auction and why are some stocks traded in this category?SEBI introduced the concept of Periodic call auctions(PDF)in 2013 as a measure to reduce volatility in illiquid stocks. Stocks that meet specific criteria of illiquidity, as outlined in the SEBI circular, such as having an average daily number of trades of less than 50 and a daily trading volume of less than 10,000, among other conditions, are included in this category.Under the Periodic Call Auction mechanism, six auction sessions are held throughout the trading day, each lasting for one hour. These sessions commence at 9:30 AM and operate similarly to the pre-market session conducted for equity stocks. During the 45-minute window, participants can place, modify, and cancel their orders. All orders received are then matched within the next eight minutes, and the resulting trades are confirmed. A seven-minute buffer period is provided before the next call auction session starts.The implementation of Periodic call auctions allows for a more structured and controlled trading environment for illiquid stocks, ensuring fair price discovery and reducing excessive volatility.Session NoStart Time- Order PlacementOrder matchingBuffer period109:30 AM - 10:15 AM10:15 AM - 10:23 AM10:24 AM to 10:30 AM210:30 AM - 11:15 AM11:15 AM - 11:23 AM11:24 AM to 11:30 AM311:30 AM - 12:15 PM12:15 PM - 12:23 PM12:24 PM to 12:30 PM412:30 PM - 01:15 PM01:15 PM - 1:23 PM01:24 PM to 01:30 PM501:30 PM - 02:15 PM02:15 PM - 2:23 PM02:24 PM to 02:30 PM602:30 PM - 03:15 PM03:15 PM - 3:23 PM03:24 PM to 03:30 PMIf the idea is to buy or sell such illiquid stocks, which are on periodic call auctions, the orders must be placed in the first 45 minutes, and the client will be able to buy or sell based on whether the order matches in the next 8 minutes.

Title: What is devolvement for commodity option and how does it work?
Content: What is devolvement for commodity option and how does it work?Devolvement refers to the conversion of an option contract into a futures contract of the same underlying. When commodity options are In the Money (ITM), they are devolved into the underlying futures contract. The strike price of the devolved options contract is the buy average for take delivery or the sell average for give delivery of the futures contract.  If the option is ITM and there aren't sufficient margins in the Zerodha account to hold till expiry, then the position will be squared off after 9 PM on the expiry day. If there are sufficient margins in the trading account and an ITM option contract is held, it will be devolved into the underlying futures contract from the very next day of expiry.On the options contract expiry date, all open ITM options contracts will be devolved into futures. The exchange blocks a margin equivalent to 25% of the futures margin required to hold the ITM option contract 2 days before expiry and 50% of the futures margin 1 day before expiry, and 100% of the futures margin for devolvement. Failing to produce the margin in the trading account can result in a square-off of open positions at Zerodha’s discretion. If the ITM options trade cannot be matched with a counterparty, it will be cash-settled.Example ScenarioGold is at 31500 levels.GOLD 19JAN 31000 CE is an ITM option contract.On expiry day, GOLD 19JAN 31000 CE will devolve into GOLD 19FEB FUT, with a buy average of 31000.Short position settlement happens based on the counter buyer consent. If a client has open hedge positions on expiry day, it may result in a net-off. In such an event, these positions won’t be carried forward. If Long futures and short call option positions are held, the short call option will be devolved into a short future position after 11:30 pm on the expiry day. In such a case, the positions will be netted off, and these won’t be carried forward.Related articlesWhat does the devolvement of ITM commodity options mean, and what impact does it have on the positions?How are MCX contracts settled?Can NSE/BSE commodities be traded at Zerodha?How to activate commodity (MCX) trading in the Zerodha account?What are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are large cap, mid cap and small cap companies, and how to identify them?
Content: What are large cap, mid cap and small cap companies, and how to identify them?Before October 2017, the categorisation of companies into large cap, mid cap, and small cap was not clearly defined by SEBI. However, on October 6, 2017, SEBI issued guidelines(WEB)that established these categories based on a company's total market capitalisation (market cap).Market cap is the market value of the outstanding shares of a company, i.e., the market value of all the shares that are held by the company’s shareholders. Market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the market price of each share.  For example, if a company has 5,00,000 shares trading at ₹500 each, its market cap is ₹25 crores (5,00,000 shares x ₹500).Companies are categorised as large, mid, or small cap in order of ranking based on their total market cap, as shown below:Categorisation in terms of market capType of companyTop 100 companiesLarge capCompanies ranking from 101 to 250Mid capCompanies ranked from the 251st position onwardSmall capTo identify a large cap, mid cap or small cap company on Kite, follow these steps:Kite appTap on the stock.Scroll down and tap onFundamentals.The type of company is mentioned beside the company name.Kite webHover over the stock and click on ⋯Click onFundamentals.To know company rankings based on their market cap, visitamfiindia.com/research-information/other-data/categorization-of-stocks.The list is updated every six months using data from the end of June and December of each year.To know company rankings based on their market cap on a day to day basis, visittickertape.in/screener/equity?allscreen=true.Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: How are shares settled in a BTST transaction?
Content: How are shares settled in a BTST transaction?In a Buy Today Sell Tomorrow (BTST) transaction, shares can be sold before they are delivered to the demat account. To learn more, seeWhat is BTST and how does it work?These transactions are settled by first crediting shares to the client’s account on the day they are received from the Clearing Corporation (CC) and earmarking them for delivery on the same day against the sale of the stock that has already been carried out.Example Scenario100 shares of Reliance were bought on Monday and sold on Tuesday.As per the T+1 settlement cycle for the purchase, the shares are transferred to the demat account on Tuesday.On Tuesday, Zerodha will earmark the 100 shares of Reliance against the sale made on Tuesday.These shares will be debited from the client’s account towards the settlement on Wednesday (T+1 from the sale made on Tuesday).By transferring the shares to the client’s account, subsequently earmarking and debiting for sale settlement, clients will be assured of getting credit for all corporate actions directly in their name. Similarly, if any TDS was deducted for dividends, the same would be filed against their PAN and reflected in their 26AS instead of being passed on from the broker's PAN.Since the shares are credited to their demat account and then debited for BTST transactions, DP charges will apply just like normal delivery transactions.

Title: Why does the LTP under holdings not match with the Marketwatch?
Content: Why does the LTP under holdings not match with the Marketwatch?There are two major stock exchanges in India: the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Stocks held in a demat account are not associated with any specific exchange. They can be bought or sold on any exchange. When selling stocks, individuals have the flexibility to choose the exchange where the price is higher, regardless of the exchange from which the stocks were originally purchased.On Kite, the stock holdings display the Last Traded Price (LTP) from the exchange where the previous closing price is higher for the stock. However, an option on the order window allows for switching between exchanges while placing an order.This means that a buyer on one exchange may offer a higher price for a stock compared to a buyer on the other exchange. Consequently, stocks can be sold on the exchange, offering a higher price for the holdings.The LTP shown on the holdings may not match the LTP on the Market watch. This can occur if the stock was added to the market watch from NSE, but the LTP displayed in the holdings is based on the quote from BSE (if the price was higher on BSE), or vice versa.Related articlesWhy does the Last Traded Price (LTP) not match the bids and offers in the market depth?Why is there a difference in the LTP on the marketwatch and the chart?Why is the LTP of stocks not visible or zero in the marketwatch on Kite?Why is there a difference between the LTP and closing price on NSE?What does the Day's range on Kite web and app represent?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is there a difference in the LTP on the marketwatch and the chart?
Content: Why is there a difference in the LTP on the marketwatch and the chart?When using Heiken Ashi (HA) charts, there is a notable difference compared to candle charts. While they may appear similar, HA charts have different behavior. In a candle chart, the Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) values represent the actual values for that time period. However, in a Heiken Ashi chart, the OHLC values are calculated as follows:HA-Close = (Open(0) + High(0) + Low(0) + Close(0)) / 4HA-Open = (HA-Open(-1) + HA-Close(-1)) / 2HA-High = Maximum value among High(0), HA-Open(0), or HA-Close(0)HA-Low = Minimum value among Low(0), HA-Open(0), or HA-Close(0)Since the price shown on the Heiken-Ashi charts are different from the LTP, the trade from charts feature isn't available for Heiken-Ashi charts.How to revert this?To revert, switch from the Heiken Ashi chart to the candlestick chart, follow the steps below:In TradingViewClick on the Candlestick symbol.Click onCandles.In ChartIQClick onDisplay.Click onCandle.Related articlesWhy is the saved layout of TradingView charts on Kite app not loading even if the names are displayed under the loaded chart layout?How to move the price scale to the left side on Chart IQ?How to save default layouts and templates on TradingView version 2 in Kite web?What are the features available on the new Chart IQ?Why has the value of historical candles on the chart changed after a refresh or opening a new chart?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

If the existing bids/offers do not have enough quantity to fulfil the order, the remaining unexecuted quantity will be matched against the next best bid/offer.Example ScenarioHere is an example of the market depth for ITC, assuming a market order is placed to buy 3500 shares:108 shares will be purchased at a price of 263.20.934 shares will be purchased at a price of 263.30.The remaining 2458 shares will be purchased at a price of 263.35.The same concept applies to limit orders in a different way. In the above example, if a limit order is placed to buy the 3500 shares at 263.20, then 108 shares would be bought immediately. However, the remaining 3392 shares would remain as a pending order in the order book. If any offer at the specified price comes in, the order will be executed.

The average price is calculated using the FIFO method. To learn more, seeHow is the buy average calculated in Console?However, disparities between Smallcase and Kite holdings after applying the filters may arise due to the following reasons:Calculation of Average Buy Price (ABP):The disparities between Kite and Smallcase holdings may arise from variances in the calculation method for Average Buy Price (ABP) of stocks. Kite employs the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method for tax purposes, while Smallcases adopt a simple average method for greater accuracy.Stocks in Smallcases sold directly on Kite:When selling stocks in Smallcases directly on Kite, the updates may not reflect in the Smallcase account, leading to a mismatch in holdings and returns. In such cases, contact the Smallcase team for assistance at[email protected].Corporate Action:If a stock undergoes a Corporate Action (CA) such as a bonus or split, the Smallcase platform immediately reflects the updated holdings. However, it usually takes around 15 days for the bonus shares to be credited to the Zerodha account.Did you know?Clients can use the tagging feature on Console to track or distinguish shares bought through Smallcases from those acquired via Kite.

Content: Why do sold stocks display as negative positions and affect P&L on Kite?If the stocks have been sold without the intention to buy back during the trading day, please ignore the negative position and the corresponding P&L change.Sold stocks are debited from the demat account on T+1 day. These stocks can be repurchased before the market closes on the same day, and such trades are known as intraday trades, which are popular among active traders.

Title: Why does the P&L on holdings and positions page on Kite change post 3.30 PM?
Content: Why does the P&L on holdings and positions page on Kite change post 3.30 PM?The P&L on the holdings and positions page on Kite changes after 3.30 PM due to the difference between the Last Traded Price (LTP) and the closing price.Equity P&L on Holdings pageDuring trading hours (9:15 AM to 3:30 PM), the LTP or live price is used to calculate the P&L for stocks on the holdings and positions page. However, after the market closes (post 3.30 PM), the exchange declares the closing price, which is the weighted average of the last 30 minutes of trading (between 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM). The holdings page then uses this closing price to calculate the value and P&L for stocks.F&O P&L on Positions pageFor futures and options (F&O), the calculation of P&L also depends on the time it is viewed:Between 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM, the LTP is used.Between 3:30 PM to midnight, the LTP at 3:30 PM is used.From the next day until 9:15 AM or market opening, the previous day's closing price is used.Since the last traded price and closing price can differ, the P&L shown on the holdings and positions page may vary accordingly.Related articlesWhat is the Day's P&L in holdings and how is it calculated?How to add a Kite widget on Android?How will the P&L for G-sec be represented on Console?How to convert Console reports to PDFs?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is there profit in the positions tab on Kite despite a higher buy average than the LTP?
Content: Why is there profit in the positions tab on Kite despite a higher buy average than the LTP?When the buy average is higher than the Last Traded Price (LTP), a profit can still be seen in the positions tab on Kite. This occurs when multiple trades have been executed in the same scrip within the trading day, and a new position is opened for that instrument.Example ScenarioAssume the client initially buys 50 shares of a stock at ₹280 and later sells them at ₹287, resulting in a profit of ₹350.Then, the client buys 70 shares of the same stock at ₹283.The buy average displayed in the positions tab is calculated by considering the total quantity traded:Buy average = ((50 * ₹280) + (70 * ₹283)) / (50 + 70) = ₹281.60 (rounded to two decimal places).If the stock price later drops to ₹280, the displayed profit or loss (P&L) will show a profit of ₹140, even though the buy average of ₹281.60 is higher than the price.This calculation method considers all the trades made in that particular scrip for the trading day, providing an overview of the P&L for those trades in the positions tab on Kite.Related articlesHow is realised and unrealised profit calculated on Kite?How to check the profit and loss (P&L) for positions on Kite web?How is the buy average calculated in Console?Why is the buy average price of some purchased shares incorrect?What could be the reason for a profit and loss report to appear incorrect?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

To learn more about BTST, seeHow to do BTST trades at Zerodha?When T1 holdings are sold, the EPI process cannot be carried out until the shares are settled in the client’s demat account. Hence, proceeds from selling T1 holdings can only be used from the next trading day when the shares are settled.Example ScenarioOn Monday (Trade day), Mr A purchased Reliance shares worth ₹10,000.On Tuesday (T1), Mr A sold these shares for the same amount.Earlier, 80% of the ₹10,000 (i.e., ₹8,000) would have been released for him to immediately place other trades or buy back the same stock after selling the T1 holdings.However, due to the new changes, funds will not be released on Tuesday.

Title: How is realised and unrealised profit calculated on Kite?
Content: How is realised and unrealised profit calculated on Kite?Realised profit on Kite is calculated when a trade is squared-off, taking into account the closed F&O and intraday equity positions. When a CNC trade is squared-off during the day, it does not affect the realised profit. However, the P&L from the intraday CNC trade that has been squared off is included in the available margin on Kite.Unrealised profit on Kite is determined by marked-to-market losses associated with open F&O and intraday equity positions. These losses are considered as unrealised profit. The marked-to-market losses reduce the available balance, but the benefit of marked-to-market profits cannot be used in the available margin. In the case of having open positions, the unrealised profit is calculated based on the net result of the positions.Example scenarioIn the scenario where position A incurs a loss of ₹100 and position B generates a profit of ₹50, the resulting unrealised profit will be -₹50. This negative value will be subtracted from the available margin.However, if position A experiences a loss of ₹100 while position B generates a profit of ₹150, the unrealised profit will amount to ₹0. This is due to the fact that the benefit of the profit cannot be utilized to increase the available margin.Similarly, the realised and unrealised profit will be negative in case of losses.Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why are holdings not displayed in the exchange where they were bought?
Content: Why are holdings not displayed in the exchange where they were bought?The stocks in the demat account do not have a specific exchange mapped to them. They can be sold on either the NSE or BSE, irrespective of the exchange where they were originally purchased. The holdings on Kite will reflect the price from the exchange where the previous closing price was higher.Generally, the prices on both exchanges should be the same. However, occasionally there may be a price difference due to various factors, such as:1. A corporate action or IPO:Check this price difference on 15th June 2020 in Alok industries due to corporate action.2. The difference in tick size:On BSE, the tick size for some stocks is ₹0.01, while on NSE, it is ₹0.05.Accordingly, when deciding to sell holdings, it is advisable to check the price on both exchanges to ensure selling on the exchange where the price is higher. The price displayed on Kite is based on the previous closing price, not the live trading price.To sell holdings from the non-default exchange, one can add the stock to Kite Marketwatch and sell it. Alternatively, the preferred exchange can be selected directly from the order window, as demonstrated below:Please refer to the BSE circular(WEB)that outlines SEBI's requirement to eliminate constant exchange preferences from trading platforms.

Content: Why does the Last traded price(LTP) for F&O contracts change in the Kite position page before the market opens?The Last traded price (LTP) value for F&O contracts on the Kite position page changes to the settlement price before the market opens. This occurs because Zerodha updates the settlement price in place of LTP once they receive the BHAVCOPY from NSE, typically between 6:30 AM and 7:00 AM the following day.The LTP (Last Traded Price) reflects the most recent actual transaction price, while the closing price on the NSE (National Stock Exchange) is determined by calculating the weighted average of prices during the final 30 minutes of trading. In the case of liquid contracts, the closing price and settlement price are identical. However, in instances where there have been no trades within the last 30 minutes for illiquid contracts, the exchange presents a theoretical settlement price.

Content: Why are there restrictions on placing Bank Nifty and Nifty option orders for certain strike prices?All strikes of Nifty and Banknifty optionsare allowed in intraday(MIS) trades. However, for overnight (NRML) trades, certain strikes are restricted from trading due to SEBI regulations that prescribe market-wide Open Interest (OI) limits.SEBI regulations mandate an upper limit on the OI of each F&O contract at every broker, set at 500 crores or 15% (whichever is higher) of the total OI for that specific contract across the market. As Zerodha has a considerable number of active users trading index options, there are restrictions on buying OTM (Out of the Money) options for specific strikes to maintain OI limits within the allowed ranges.Coincidentally, we have observed that the restriction on buying naked OTM options, which are the riskiest contracts, reduces the overall risk for traders.What is allowed?Option buying and selling in all strikes in intraday (MIS) trades.Option selling or writing in all strikes with no restrictions.Long positions are allowed of any range till their count is equal to the short futures or options position one holds.How to trade restricted strikes?The trading of restricted strikes is made possible through a custodian system.

Title: Why does P&L in Kite positions not match with gains on the funds page?
Content: Why does P&L in Kite positions not match with gains on the funds page?The reason for the disparity between the P&L in Kite positions and the gains displayed on the funds page is due to the different methodologies used to calculate them. On Kite, the P&L is determined based on the original entry price of your positions. However, on the funds page, the gains are calculated based on the last Marked to Market (M2M) settlement price for open futures and short options positions.This distinction arises because of the standardized exchange process known as Marked to Market (M2M), which is employed for accounting purposes and ledger adjustments in futures trading. At the end of each day, all open futures positions are marked to the closing settlement price for that day. The profits or losses are then credited or debited accordingly in the client's funds statement. This M2M process helps mitigate counterparty risk and ensures prompt collection of losses from those who incurred them while crediting profits to those who made gains. To learn more about M2M, seeWhat is Mark to Market (MTM)?Short option positions, on the other hand, do not go through the same M2M process as futures. Instead, the margin required to hold short options increases as the options move in the money, resulting in losses for short options. This mechanism ensures that customers facing losses are required to contribute additional funds, reducing the risk of default.Therefore, the overall P&L will ultimately be the same on both platforms. However, the daily P&L or credit/debit reflected on the funds page may differ due to the distinct calculation methods employed in Kite positions and the funds page.Related articlesHow is realised and unrealised profit calculated on Kite?How will the P&L for G-sec be represented on Console?How to view or download the profit and loss report?How does Zerodha deduct TDS for NRI NON-PIS accounts?What is Mark to Market (MTM)?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why has the value of historical candles on the chart changed after a refresh or opening a new chart?
Content: Why has the value of historical candles on the chart changed after a refresh or opening a new chart?When a chart is opened, live candles are formed on the user's computer or mobile using the ticks or prices streamed from Zerodha's end. Historical candles or the pre-existing candles on the chart are stored at Zerodha's end using the market data received from exchanges. The data used to form candles on the user's device could be a subset of the actual data received by Zerodha. This can happen due to variations in internet speed and uptime, resulting in the user receiving fewer ticks. Consequently, the candles plotted on the user's device may slightly differ from the candles saved at Zerodha's end for historical data. When the user refreshes the chart or opens a new one, Zerodha streams the historical candles, replacing the previously plotted candles from the time the chart was opened. This can lead to slight differences in how the chart appears upon refreshing or reopening the same chart.Opening price of the day on Kite chartsTo ensure accuracy, Zerodha adjusts the opening price of the day at around 9:20 AM, as the market opening can experience a surge in ticks, causing potential discrepancies. The opening price is adjusted using the actual open price published by the exchanges, which is the pre-market opening price of 9:07 AM for stocks and the actual opening price seen in the market depth for F&O instruments. As a result, when the historical candles are recalculated and refreshed on the chart, they reflect the actual opening price published by the exchanges, not the opening price captured by the candles on the user's end.Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Content: Why are some of the indicators on the website of Tradingview not available in TradingView charts on Kite?Tradingview's website features a public library where traders can share indicators. In contrast, Kite offers a built-in library of indicators instead of a public one. As a result, certain indicators found on tradingview.com are not accessible on the TradingView chart within Kite.

Title: Why do the colour on bar charts and volume bars not match sometimes?
Content: Why do the colour on bar charts and volume bars not match sometimes?The colour of volume bars can be different from a candle chart due to differences in the colour selection criteria. The colour selection criteria are as follows:For price candlesIt is based on a stock's opening and closing price in a given time frame.The candle will be green if the open price < close price.The candle will be red if the open price > close price.For volume barsThe candle will be green if the candle's closing price > previous candle's closing priceThe candle will be red if the candle's closing price < previous candle's closing price.Accordingly, in a given time frame, if the closing price is greater than the opening price, but the candle's closing price is lesser than the previous candle's closing price, a green candlestick and a red volume bar will be formed.

Title: Why is the volume chart indicator not working for Nifty or other indices?
Content: Why is the volume chart indicator not working for Nifty or other indices?The volume chart indicator reflects the number of shares or contracts bought and sold within a specific timeframe. However, direct trading is not possible when it comes to indices like Nifty or other similar ones. Instead, trading on indices is conducted through derivatives, i.e. F&O contracts or ETFs. As indices do not have actual trades taking place, there is no available volume data. Consequently, it is not possible to add volume-based indicators to the charts for indices due to the absence of trading activity.Related articlesWhy do the colour on bar charts and volume bars not match sometimes?What are the features available on the new Chart IQ?Why isn't the advanced alerts feature, previously on Sentinel, visible on Kite?Why is the error 'The market order was rejected since there are no trades in this instrument.

Content: Why are the charts of the same timeframe for the same stock not matching while comparing them with other platforms?On the exchange, there are hundreds of transactions per second, and each one is represented by a tick. The trading or charting platform only displays one tick per second from hundreds of ticks received every second. The charts may not match because the tick points captured and plotted on charts differ from platform to platform. Even if the charts differ slightly, the overall trend is consistent across all charting platforms.The mismatch will only be in minute and hourly candles as the exchange shares daily OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and not minute/hourly OHLC for the day in the Bhavcopy.Did you know?The client can subscribe to the tick-by-tick data of NSE through any of the authorised data vendors to see all the ticks.

Title: How are the pivot points derived while using the Central Pivot Range (CPR)?
Content: How are the pivot points derived while using the Central Pivot Range (CPR)?The Central Pivot Range (CPR) is an indicator to identify key price points to set up trades. The CPR consists of three components:PivotBottom Central Pivot (BC)Top Central Pivot (TC)These are derived from the underlying high, low, and close price calculations:Pivot = (High + Low + Close) ÷ 3.Bottom CPR = (High + Low) ÷ 2.Top CPR = (Pivot - BC) + Pivot.Example ScenarioThe chart of SBIN on 24/08/2022 (the previous day) has it's Open (O) - 519, High (H) - 523, Low (L) - 512.3, and Close (C) - 519.3.On 25/08/2022, the pivot point data was 518.53. i.e. (H+L+C ÷ 3)Here if the pivot point data is ascertained from the OHLC data of 25/08/2022, it will not match with the pivot points as it is calculated using the previous day’s OHLC.The formula for calculating pivot points is mentioned below, with an example on Kite ChartIQ.Assume XYZ’s stock has its High (H) - 129.7, Low (L) - 126.9 and Close (C) - 127.35, respectively. So the pivot points in Kite would be calculated as follows:KITE(ChartIQ)Pivot point = (H + L + C) / 3127.98First support level (S1) = (2 * P) – H126.27Second support level (S2) = P – (H – L)125.18Third support level (S3) = P – 2*(H-L)122.38First resistance level (R1) = (2 * P) – L129.07Second resistance level (R2) = P + (H – L)130.78Third resistance level (R3) = P + 2*(H – L)133.58Did you know?CPR helps the trader identify key price points and the associated trend around these price points.

Title: Why are the OHLC values on daily and hourly charts different?
Content: Why are the OHLC values on daily and hourly charts different?The OHLC values on daily and hourly charts differ due to how the data is collected and processed. Daily charts are formed using the BHAVCOPY data provided by the exchange, which is updated after the trading day ends. This bhavcopy data includes accurate information formed using all the ticks that occurred on the exchange throughout the day.On the other hand, the minute and hourly charts are formed using live data received from the exchange. However, this live data is not tick by tick and does not include all the transactions within that specific time interval. Instead, it is a continuous feed of data that provides an overview of the market activity.Since the exchange does not share minute or hourly OHLC values in the bhavcopy, the minute or hourly charts are formed using the live feed that the trading platform, such as Zerodha, receives. This discrepancy in data sources and processing methods leads to a mismatch between the OHLC values on daily and hourly charts.Related articlesWhat are the features available on the new Chart IQ?How are the pivot points derived while using the Central Pivot Range (CPR)?Why is there a difference between the pivot points calculated manually and the pivot study on Kite charts?How to get continuous chart data for futures contracts on Kite?Why is “Error while fetching data” displayed on Kite app?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why do two charts of the same timeframe look different on the same platform?
Content: Why do two charts of the same timeframe look different on the same platform?The reason two charts of the same timeframe may appear different on the same platform is due to the way the charts are formed. A chart is created by plotting various price points on a graph, which are derived from live server data, specifically from the market watch ticks. However, when a chart is opened midway, it is plotted using data points that are already stored on the data server. This can lead to a slight disparity in how the chart appears.The difference arises because the broadcast of live ticks and the number of stored ticks per second may not be exactly the same. When viewing the live chart, there might be 4 or 5 price points used to plot the graph. However, when opening a new chart, it may form from price points retrieved from the data server, which might have recorded only 1 tick within the same timeframe. This variation in the number of price points used for plotting can contribute to the differences observed between two charts of the same timeframe on the same platform.Related articlesWhy are the charts of the same timeframe for the same stock not matching while comparing them with other platforms?Why is OHLC data different on live charts and marketwatch?Why is there a difference between the pivot points calculated manually and the pivot study on Kite charts?Why is the moving average not visible on weekly and monthly charts after applying the time period as 200 months?What are the features available on the new Chart IQ?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is there a difference between the pivot points calculated manually and the pivot study on Kite charts?
Content: Why is there a difference between the pivot points calculated manually and the pivot study on Kite charts?The intraday candles on Kite charts are formed using live data from the exchange, which may not record all the transactions that took place in the interval. On the other hand, the daily candles are updated on the exchange bhavcopy data. To learn more, seeWhy are the OHLC values on daily and hourly charts different?If an intraday chart is opened, the charting engine will only have historical intraday data points and will not have daily data points. So, to find the previous day's Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) the intraday chart will look at all the candles on the previous day and then take these points.So in a 5 minutes chart, the charting engine will have only 5 minutes data points historically, not 1-day data points. Therefore, to find the previous day’s OHLC, the 5-minute chart will look at all the candles from the previous day and then take these points. This may lead to a difference between pivot points calculated manually and pivot study on Kite charts.Example ScenarioThe chart of SBIN on 24/08/2022 (the previous day) has it's Open (O) - 519, High (H) - 523, Low (L) - 512.3, and Close (C) - 519.3.On 25/08/2022, the pivot point data was 518.53. i.e. (H+L+C ÷ 3)Here if the pivot point data is ascertained from the OHLC data of 25/08/2022, it will not match with the pivot points as it is calculated using the previous day’s OHLC.The formula for calculating pivot points is mentioned below with an example on Kite ChartIQ.Assume XYZ’s stock has its High (H) - 129.7, Low (L) - 126.9 and Close (C) - 127.35, respectively. So the pivot points in Kite would be calculated as follows :KITE(ChartIQ)Pivot point = (H + L + C) / 3127.98First support level (S1) = (2 * P) – H126.27Second support level (S2) = P – (H – L)125.18Third support level (S3) = P – 2*(H-L)122.38First resistance level (R1) = (2 * P) – L129.07Second resistance level (R2) = P + (H – L)130.78Third resistance level (R3) = P + 2*(H – L)133.58Did you know?On the TradingView chart, the OHLC points from the daily candles are always in sync with the exchange data, and there will be no mismatch between the TradingView pivot data and the pivot points calculated manually.Related articlesWhat are the features available on the new Chart IQ?Why is OHLC data different on live charts and marketwatch?Why do two charts of the same timeframe look different on the same platform?Why is there a difference in the LTP on the marketwatch and the chart?Why is the error 'It seems you’re not logged in.

Title: How to get continuous chart data for futures contracts on Kite?
Content: How to get continuous chart data for futures contracts on Kite?To get continuous chart data for future contracts, follow the steps below:Click onDisplay.SelectContinuous data.This feature is available only for futures contracts on ChartIQ on a daily, weekly and monthly timeframe. To know how to switch between TradingView to ChartIQ, seeHow to switch between TradingView and ChartIQ charts on Kite?What is a continuous futures chart?Continuous futures charts categorize futures into current, near, and far months, rather than plotting charts for a specific month. Since all futures contracts expire within three months, historical charts provide a maximum of three months of available data. Within these three months, the majority of trading activity is concentrated on the current month's contract. While analyzing charts for underlying instruments is possible, historical charts for futures contracts are more popular due to their higher trading activity. In the case of currencies, spot price charts are not available, so it becomes necessary to refer to futures charts. Instead of examining the historical chart for a specific month's Nifty April 2022 futures contract, which would only cover a three-month period, it is advisable to analyze continuous futures charts formed by utilizing Nifty April futures contract data in April, Nifty March futures contract data in March, and so on.Why is there no continuous options chart?Continuous charts cannot be constructed for options because they operate differently from futures. While the intrinsic value of futures remains constant between two months, options behave differently. All at-the-money (ATM) and out-of-the-money (OTM) options expire worthless, reaching a value of 0. Consequently, it is not feasible to create continuous charts for options.Related articlesWhat are the features available on the new Chart IQ?Why is OHLC data different on live charts and marketwatch?Why do two charts of the same timeframe look different on the same platform?Can historical and live data taken from Kite Connect API be used on other platforms?What is an Annual Information Statement (AIS) ?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why are option orders rejected, stating that limit orders that are far away from the LTP are restricted?
Content: Why are option orders rejected, stating that limit orders that are far away from the LTP are restricted?The price discovery process or mechanism is an activity where prices are determined by the demand and supply of a security through the interaction between the buyers and sellers via orders placed. It has been observed that few traders are placing orders which are in no way related to the current market price of the contract, or orders are placed with prices that are far away from the last traded price. Trades placed at such unrealistic prices may lead to instability in the price discovery process which may lead to freak trades. To learn more about freak trades, visitzerodha.com/z-connect/traders-zone/freak-trades-in-fo-removal-of-execution-range-the-importance-of-limit-orders-and-moreTo curb this issue, Zerodha is blocking limit orders for stock and index option trades that are placed 50% to 150% away from the last traded price (LTP). This block only applies if a trader is trying to place a limit buy order at a higher price, i.e. 150% away from the LTP, and sell at a lower price, i.e. 50% away from the LTP. This block won't be applicable if the LTP is lower than ₹100. If a trader still wants to place a limit order outside of these limits, GTT orders can be used. To learn more about GTT orders, seeWhat is the Good Till Triggered (GTT) feature?For stock option contracts,trading is completely blocked for the near-month and the far-month contract if the LTP and the open interest are zero.

Content: Why is the error 'Trigger price can’t be higher than price' or 'Trigger price can’t be lesser than price' displayed while placing a stop loss order?This error occurs for stoploss orders when the trigger and limit prices are entered incorrectly. A stoploss order requires a trigger price and a limit price. This error can be observed in the following cases:Buy stop-loss orders:If the stop-loss trigger price is higher than the limit price.Sell stop-loss orders:If the stop-loss trigger price is lower than the limit price.In such cases, the orders will be pending and fail to execute.Example ScenarioIf a client holds a stock currently trading at ₹100, with a trigger price set at ₹95 and a limit selling price of ₹96.When the trigger price, ₹95, is met, a limit sell order is placed at ₹96.However, since this limit order price is higher than the current market price, it becomes a pending order and does not execute.To increase the likelihood of order execution, consider entering a limit order with a price lower than ₹95.When placing a buy SL order, ensure the trigger price is lower than or equal to the limit price. For a sell SL order, set the trigger price higher than or equal to the limit price. To learn more about stoploss orders, seeWhat are stop loss orders and how to use them?Did you know?You can use stop-loss market(SL-M) orders where the order is placed at the market price once the trigger is hit.

Title: What does the error 'The order was cancelled by the exchange because the price is outside the current allowed limit price protection range' mean?
Content: What does the error 'The order was cancelled by the exchange because the price is outside the current allowed limit price protection range' mean?When the price in a limit order is placed outside of the Limit Price Protection (LPP) range in an index/stock options contract(PDF)or index/stock futures contract(PDF),the order is rejected with the reason:The order was cancelled by the exchange because the price is outside the current allowed limit price protection rangeThe LPP range is dynamic or changes with the change in the price of the contract. This is set by the exchanges to strengthen the pre-trade risk control measures in order to prevent freak trades or trades that can get executed at far above or below the current market price. To know more about freak trades, visitzrd.sh/freak-fo-trades-limit-orders.LPP is applicable to limit orders and Stop loss - Limit order (SL-L) orders in stock and index F&O contracts.

The order will be rejected if it’s placed outside of this range.However, if the premium is trading at ₹25,  the range will be +/-20₹ as the premium is trading below ₹50.Upper range:25+20 = ₹45Lower range:25-20 = ₹5The limit or SL-limit order should be placed between the range of ₹45 and ₹5.

Title: What is Price Reasonability Range (PRR)?
Content: What is Price Reasonability Range (PRR)?The Price Reasonability Range (PRR) is a functionality implemented by the exchange(WEB),in the derivatives segment with the goal to improve the exchange's pre-trade risk management framework. The primary purpose of PRR is to prevent potential market abuses and errors caused by significant price deviations. This helps to support authentic price discovery and protect the interests of investors.Within the Price Reasonability Checks (PRC) functionality, each new limit order's price is checked against the dynamically determined PRR. This calculation relies on real-time reference prices, typically sourced from best bid/offer prices for each contract or security. The system ensures that incoming limit order prices reasonably align with current market prices.Key features of the Price Reasonability Check (PRC) include:It applies to incoming limit orders.It checks incoming limit order prices against the current PRR.PRR is dynamically computed using real-time reference prices, like best bid/offer prices or, if unavailable, the Last Trade Price (LTP) or the previous closing price.The system adapts in real time, switching between reference prices based on the order book's conditions.Existing price bands are also used for risk management, ensuring that PRR remains within predefined thresholds for each contract/security.PRC is applicable to all futures and option contracts in the equity derivatives segment, except for calendar spreads and paired option contracts.PRR is calculated as an absolute value and corresponds to specific order price categories.PRR slabs for BANKEX and SENSEX can be found on the BSE circular(WEB).Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is the order execution time displayed beyond the market hours on Kite?
Content: Why is the order execution time displayed beyond the market hours on Kite?Order execution time refers to the specific time when a trade is executed at the exchange and it is always within the market hours. For instance, if a client places an order at 1:30 PM and it is promptly executed, the broker receives confirmation from the exchange at the same time and displays the execution time accordingly on the trading platform.However, the order execution time could be displayed beyond market hours if there’s a disconnection between the broker and the exchange due to connectivity issues. In such a scenario, the trading platform displays orders placed during this period asOPEN PENDING, CANCEL PENDINGorMODIFY PENDING.To resolve this, the broker performs an exchange reconciliation process when the broker reconnects with the exchange. This process involves the broker retrieving data from the exchange and matching it with the pending orders placed during the period of disconnection.

Title: Why is trading restricted for Nifty Midcap contracts?
Content: Why is trading restricted for Nifty Midcap contracts?Trading is only allowed for Nifty Midcap's current week's option contract and the current month's futures contract. Nifty Midcap contracts are restricted from trading because they are illiquid. Trading in illiquid contracts involves the following risks:Bid-ask spread:Illiquid contracts tend to have wide bid-ask spreads. A bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. A wider spread may result in a higher cost of trading and lower profits.Limited market depth:Illiquid contracts may have limited market depth. There may not be enough buyers or sellers in the market to execute trades at the desired prices. This can make it difficult to enter or exit a position.Increased volatility:Because of the limited trading activity in illiquid contracts, prices can be more volatile, which can result in sudden and large price movements.The exchange's client-wise position limit for the MIDCPNIFTY contract may be lower than its lot size on some days. As a result, traders are blocked from taking new positions or closing existing ones on such days.Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is the Kite alert not triggered even though the conditions are met?
Content: Why is the Kite alert not triggered even though the conditions are met?Even if the conditions are met, Kite alerts may not be triggered if the tick is not captured. The system triggers an alert when a stock price reaches or crosses the set trigger price based on the ticks recorded or shown live. Since hundreds of transactions occur on the exchange every second, each represented by a tick, a tick can be missed. If the tick is missed, the alert may not be triggered and may remain pending until the stock price again reaches the trigger price.Example scenarioAssume the price of XYZ Ltd is ₹105, and the Kite alert is set to be triggered when the stock reaches ₹100.The stock momentarily reached the trigger price of ₹100, and the tick wasn't recorded in the system.

Title: Why is the money debited from my trading account for the purchase of G-bonds more than the allotment amount shown in Coin?
Content: Why is the money debited from my trading account for the purchase of G-bonds more than the allotment amount shown in Coin?When you buy G-bonds through Non-competitive bidding (Non-competitive bidding means the bidder would be able to participate in the auctions of dated government securities without having to quote the yield or price in the bid) these bonds will allotted to you at theweighted averagerate of all allotments to competitive bidders. This rate will be theclean pricei.e price not including anyaccrued interest. This is what is shown on Kite as well (i.eno. of units owned X clean price)RBI generally re-issues a G-bond till a sizable amount becomes outstanding under that bond. For Re-issues, the settlement will happen atDirty price(even in non-competitive bidding).If an interest bearing security is bought or sold between two interest payment dates - the buyer has to compensate the seller by paying the seller, that part of the interest which is due to the seller (from the last interest payment date to the trade date). The calculation of the accrued interest is done according to the day count convention of the security market i.e for G-bonds RBI considers 360 days as number of days in the whole year & 30 days in a month.So, you as a non-competitive bidder, willpay the weighted average price (clean price) which emerges in the auction and in addition, also payinterest accruedfrom the last interest payment date to the date of re-issue of the security. (Accrued interest is calculated using coupon rate and time from last coupon payment).This is because, on the Interest payment date, you will get paid the interest amount for the entire duration from the previous interest payment date. However, you would've purchased the bond in between and not owned the bond for the entire duration.This is similar to the price adjustments in stock when dividends are issued.Let us understand this with an example -7.72 %  GS 2055 is a bond which is being re-issued. The auction for the re-issue happens on 19th October and the settlement happens on 22nd October. Now the interest payment dates are Oct 26 and Apr 26, and the last payment date is April 26, 2018. You place a bid for Rs 10000 and you get the allotment on 22nd October and the weighted average price (clean price) is 93.9Now, when you get the interest payment on October 26th you will get the whole amount i.e (7.72% ÷ 2 x 10000 =Rs 386), even though you haven't held the bond since April 26.Which is why, when the amount is blocked initially, the accrued interest is also considered. So, the amount which is actually blocked will be (clean price x units) + (accrued interest for these units). The accrued interest will be calculated as shownhereon the RBI website.Accrued interest will be - (7.72 ÷ 2) x (178 ÷ 360) = 1.908*7.72 is the coupon rate. It is divided by 2 as interest is paid semi annually. 178 is the no. of days for which the interest is accrued i.e last date of coupon payment up to date of issue (Apr 26 to Oct 21). For G-bonds RBI considers 360 days as number of days in the whole year & 30 days in a month.The consideration blocked will be 93.9 + 1.908 = 95.808 x 100 units, this will amount Rs 9580The amount shown will be - 9390, and the difference will beRs 188.This is the reason for the difference in the amount debited and the amount shown on Kite. You will receive this difference accrued interest component in your bank account on the Coupon payment date.

Title: How to calculate returns on government securities?
Content: How to calculate returns on government securities?T-bills -There are three T-bills variants and they vary based on the maturity period. They are 91 days, 182 days, and 364 days. T-bills do not carry an interest component, in fact, this is one of the biggest difference between T-bills and Bonds. T-bills are issued at a discount to their true (PAR) value and upon expiry, its redeemed at its true value.For ex -consider a 91-day T-bill. Assume the true value (also called the Par value), is Rs.100. This T-bill is issued to you at a discount to its par value, Say Rs.97. After 91 days, you will get back Rs.100 and therefore you make a return of Rs.3. Think of it, this is as good as buying a stock at Rs.97 and selling it after 91 days at Rs.100.  The only difference is that this is a guaranteed transaction, meaning, there is no risk of you selling below 100 (or above 100).Yield essentially measures the return on your investment on an annualized basis. After all, all investments should be measured by its returns on an annualized basis. So if you have made 3 bucks over 91 days on an investment of Rs.97, then at this rate, how much would you have made on a yearly basis?The formula is –Yield = [Discount Value]/[Bond Price] * [365/number of days to maturity]= [3/97]*[365/91]= 0.0309*4.010989=12.4052%So in other words, the T-bill offers a return on investment of 12.4052%, but since you held it for 91 days, you will enjoy this return on a pro-rata basis.Typical 91-day yields are around 6-7.5%. Needless to say, the higher the yield, the better it is.Note:All yields are annualizedBonds -Bonds differ from T-bills on 2 counts. Bonds have long-dated maturities and they pay interest twice a year. Every bond issued will have a unique name or symbol. The symbol contains all the information you’d need. For example here is a symbol – 740GS2035A, and here is what this really means –Annualized interest – 7.40%Type – Government Securities (GS)Maturity – 2035Issue – ‘A’  means its a fresh issue (don’t worry much about this, just be aware that this is NSE’s internal nomenclature for their own book-keeping)This issue is expiring in 2035 or 17 years from now (we are in 2018). If you were to invest in this bond, you will receive 7.4% interest every year until its maturity in 2035. Please note, the interest will be paid semi-annually, so you will get 3.7% interest twice a year. Finally, upon maturity, you will also get back your principal amount.Every bond has a Par value, of say Rs.100. When you invest in a bond, you usually invest either at a discount (ex: 98, 97 etc) or at par (100), or at a premium to par (101,102 etc). The price at which you invest in a bond depends on something called as an ‘auction process’.Now, consider you invest in 700GS2020 (7% with a maturity of 2020 or 2 years from now) at a discount price of 98.4. Assume, you invested in 150 of these bonds, so you’d pay –150*98.4= Rs. 14,760/-Time PeriodInterestCash flowRemarks0 – 6 Months3.5%3.5% * 100 * 150 = Rs.525Half year interest6 months – 1 year3.5%3.5% * 100 * 150 = Rs.525Half year interest1 – 1.5 years3.5%3.5% * 100 * 150 = Rs.525Half year interest1.5 – 2 years3.5%3.5% * 100 * 150 = Rs.525Half year interestAt Maturity (2 years)Principal repayment at Par150 * 100 = 15,000Additional Rs.240So on an investment of Rs.14,760/- you will earn –525 + 525 + 525 + 525 + 15,000= 2100 + 15,000= Rs.17,100/-If you do the math, the yield on this works out to approximately 7.88%.

Title: What is the disclosed quantity feature and how to use it?
Content: What is the disclosed quantity feature and how to use it?Disclosed quantity feature while placing equity orders allows only a part of the total order quantity to be disclosed to the market as shown in the market depth. Once a part of the order is executed, the next part is disclosed to the market. This feature can be used while placing large orders to reduce impact cost and to get a better execution by disclosing only a portion of the large order in the best bids and offers in the market depth.Impact costImpact cost represents the difference in the actual traded price as compared to the price of the instrument when the order was placed. For example, if a market order to buy 1000 shares was placed when the stock was trading at ₹100, and if the actual execution price was ₹100.5, this ₹0.5 x 1000 = ₹500 would be the impact cost for the order.Similarly, if a limit order to buy 1000 shares was placed at ₹100 when the stock was trading at ₹100 and later modified to 100.3 to get a fill, 0.3 x 1000 = ₹300 is technically the impact cost.As the size of the order increases, the impact cost also increases. Traders with large order values end up losing a lot more money to impact costs as compared to all other charges combined (STT, Brokerage, exchange transaction, etc.).How to use the disclosed quantity feature?Click on More on the order window.Enter the quantity in theDisclosed qtywindow.Example scenarioA buy order for ITC for 25000 quantity with a disclosed quantity of 5000 will mean that only 5000 quantity will be displayed in the market depth and the next 5000 will get placed only after the execution of the first 5000.Exchanges follow a "price-time priority" principle for orders. So this means that in the above example, once the first 5000 is executed, the next 5000 will be placed based on price-time priority and orders placed before this will have priority.Did you know?Disclosed quantity can’t be used when trading futures & options, but Iceberg orders can be placed instead. To learn more about Iceberg orders, seeWhat are Iceberg orders, and how to use them?Different exchanges have different minimum disclosed quantity criteria:NSE/BSE (Equity):Disclosed quantity cannot be less than 10% of the order.CDS/BCD (Currency):Disclosed quantity cannot be less than 10% of the order.MCX (Commodity):Disclosed quantity cannot be less than 25% of the order.The conditions for disclosed quantity can be found on the NSE website(WEB)underOrder Conditions.Related articlesHow to place basket orders on Kite?How to use the basket order feature on Kite app?What are call and trade charges?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is margin benefit not provided for the covered call strategy in Zerodha?
Content: Why is margin benefit not provided for the covered call strategy in Zerodha?Margin benefit is not provided for the covered call strategy in Zerodha because exchanges do not offer margin benefit for stock option positions against the underlying stock held in the client’s portfolio. While margin benefit is available for futures positions, providing cross-margin benefit within the existing framework is operationally challenging. The broker would need to upload files with specific details, and even if they intend to offer this facility, they must meet certain clearing and settlement criteria, which are currently difficult to fulfil.Additionally, there are a few points to consider apart from the operational complexity:Spread benefit is only passed for futures and not for options.Portfolios with hedge benefits or calendar spreads will not receive cross-margin benefits since these portfolios are already covered for risk. To learn more, visitnseindia.com/products-services/equity-market-cross-margining.The portfolio should be an exact replica of the index, meaning the number of shares in the holdings or the stock futures position should be equal to the lot size, and no partial benefit is provided.If a client has a short delivery position against their holdings and fails to square off or roll over, their shares will be debited towards the obligation.Cross-margin benefit can only be given for index and stock futures if they belong to the same expiry months.Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why does Zerodha increase intraday margins for MIS and CO on days when the market is volatile?
Content: Why does Zerodha increase intraday margins for MIS and CO on days when the market is volatile?Margins are collected from customers to prevent defaults based on minimum exchange requirements. Margin requirements are adjusted based on the volatility of a security - more volatility means higher margins, and less volatility means lower margins.  However, during events such as election results or budget day, minimum margin requirements set by exchanges may not reflect the actual market volatility. To manage this, Zerodha may increase margins higher than the minimum required by the exchanges. Once the volatility subsides or the event passes without any volatility, Zerodha will revert to the minimum required margins. MIS can also be disabled for certain securities depending on the market volatility.Stocks allowed to trade and leverage offered can be checked on Zerodha’s margin calculator(WEB).Presently available leverages and any changes in Zerodha’s policy are updated on the bulletin and can be seen by visitingzerodha.com/marketintel/bulletin/latest-intraday-leverages-mis-bo-co.Still need help?Create a ticket

Title: What are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?
Content: What are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?The exchange requires a minimum margin to be collected from the client for each trade. The specific margins charged by the exchange can vary depending on the trading segment. The different types of margins that need to be collected as per exchange guidelines are as follows:For EquityVar + ELM (Upfront margin):The upfront margin is the minimum amount required to initiate a trade. In the equity segment, the exchange mandates(WEB)the collection of at least 20% of the traded value, or Value at Risk (VaR) + Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), whichever is higher, from the client for both delivery and intraday trades. However, Zerodha collects the full value of the trade for delivery trades, also known as Cash and Carry (CNC) trades. For intraday trades, Zerodha offers up to 5 times leverage (equivalent to 20% of the traded value) through the use of Margin Intraday Square off (MIS) and Cover Order (CO) for equities. To learn more about VaR and ELM, seeWhat is Value at Risk (VAR), Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), and Adhoc margins?Adhoc margins:Adhoc margins are additional margins that exchanges can impose as needed (ad hoc basis). Adhoc margins may be levied when the exchange identifies an increased risk due to potential defaults, market volatility, or other conditions that might result in greater losses. These margins are over and above the usual required margins, safeguarding the markets and its participants against unforeseen risks.Mark-to-Market (MTM) loss margins:Exchange requires MTM loss margins to be collected in case of intraday losses.Why does Zerodha collect the full amount instead of 20% of VaR + ELM for equity delivery trades?Zerodha collects the full amount for equity delivery trades rather than 20% of VaR + ELM because when stocks are purchased using the CNC product type, the trader intends to take delivery of them. This requires full payment as it is not a leveraged trade.The next trading day following the purchase, Zerodha, as the broker, is obligated to pay this money to the clearing corporation to secure the stocks for delivery. Hence, Zerodha collects a 100% upfront margin for CNC trades.However, stocks can be bought for delivery with lesser margins using the Margin Trading Facility (MTF). Zerodha is working on this and will be available soon.For DerivativesSPAN and Exposure (Upfront margin)The exchange mandates the collection of SPAN and Exposure margins as upfront margins in the derivatives or F&O segment. However, for option buying, only the premium is required to be collected. The margin requirement for both intraday (MIS) and carry-forward (NRML) positions is the same because derivatives are inherently leveraged. The margin that is blocked in a client’s trading account for derivatives positions is also called theInitial Marginand is the sum of these two components, i.e., SPAN and Exposure margins.  To learn more, seeWhat is SPAN and exposure margin?SPAN and Exposure margins will be blocked in the client's trading account for the duration of their futures trade. The initial margin value keeps changing daily due to its dependency on the futures price. Even though the lot size is constant, changes in the futures price lead to changes in the margin requirements.There are a few reasons that could lead to an increase in the SPAN and Exposure margins:Exiting hedged positions:There will be a margin shortfall if the client exits a position that provides the margin benefit in a hedged trade, thereby increasing the required margin. To learn more, seeCan exiting one leg of a hedged position lead to a peak margin shortfall?Expiry of one of the hedged positions:The required margin may increase if one or more contracts in the hedged portfolio expire. This is because the hedge may break, causing the margin benefit to be lost, resulting in a margin shortfall.Change in overall portfolio margin:Buying or selling one or more positions might lead to a change in overall portfolio margins, resulting in a margin shortfall.Volatility:The minimum margin required to hold a position might increase because of intraday volatility, leading to a margin shortfall.Mark-to-market margin (MTM margin) for FuturesMark-to-market (MTM) in futures involves the daily revaluation of open contracts to calculate profit or loss based on price changes in the underlying asset. It requires comparing the contract's entry price with the current market price and adjusting the trader's account accordingly. To facilitate this settlement, traders must maintain additional funds, i.e., the MTM margin, in their trading account. This ensures that there are sufficient funds in their trading account to cover potential losses from open positions. To learn more, seeWhat is Mark to Market (MTM)?Physical delivery marginsFutures and Options (F&O) positions may require the delivery of the actual shares upon expiry. When buying option contracts, there's no need to block SPAN and exposure margin in the account, as the margin requirement and risk are limited to the option's value.However, due to new physical delivery rules, in-the-money (ITM) options now result in the delivery of the underlying shares. The exchange imposes physical delivery margins on ITM options starting four days before expiration. These margins are calculated as a percentage of the applicable margins (VAR + ELM + Adhoc) of the underlying stock.Day (BOD-Beginning of the day)Margins applicableE-4 Day (Friday)10% of VaR + ELM +Adhoc marginsE-3 Day (Monday)25% of VaR + ELM +Adhoc marginsE-2 Day (Tuesday)45% of VaR + ELM +Adhoc marginsE-1 Day (Wednesday)25% of the contract valueExpiry Day (Thursday)50% of the contract valueTo learn more, seeWhat is Zerodha's policy on the physical settlement of equity derivatives on expiry?Commodity segment (MCX)Initial Margin (Upfront Margin)The upfront initial margin includes the net buy premium and the Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), both of which must be collected in advance, i.e., upfront. Therefore, when reporting margins, a client's upfront initial margin is the sum of the contract level initial margin, net buy premium, and ELM. It's mandatory for brokers to collect these initial margins from their clients before any trading activity takes place.There are a few reasons that could lead to an increase in the upfront margins:Exiting hedged positions:There will be a margin shortfall if the client exits a position that provides the margin benefit in a hedged trade, thereby increasing the required margin. To learn more, seeCan exiting one leg of a hedged position lead to a peak margin shortfall?Expiry of one of the hedged positions:The required margin may increase if one or more contracts in the hedged portfolio expire.

Margins not included in theInitial Marginare classified asOther Margins. This category comprisesAdditional Margin, Special Margin, Tender Margin, Delivery Margin,andConcentration Margin,all of which the broker must collect from the clients. AsOther Marginis not collected upfront, any shortfall in it can be collected until the next day (t+1 Day).MTM margin (Non-upfront margin)For futures contracts, the profit or loss calculated at the end of each trading day, known as the mark-to-market margin, forms part of the margin reporting and must be collected from the clients. In the case of options, the Exercise/Assignment Obligation at the contract's expiry is combined with the Mark to Market requirement for margin purposes.

Title: What is Zerodha's policy on the physical settlement of equity derivatives on expiry?
Content: What is Zerodha's policy on the physical settlement of equity derivatives on expiry?All stock F&O contracts traded on Indian exchanges require compulsory delivery. If an individual holds an ITM stock option or a futures contract upon expiry, they must give or take delivery of the underlying stock². Conversely, OTM stock options are worthless upon expiry and do not impose any delivery obligation⁸. Index F&O contracts, on the other hand, are cash-settled.The table below illustrates delivery obligations for stock F&O contracts post-expiry.Security receivableSecurity deliverableFuturesLong futuresShort futuresCall optionsLong ITM CallShort ITM CallPut optionsShort ITM PutLong ITM putTaking or giving delivery of the entire contract value worth of stocks requires either full cash or stocks in the Zerodha account post-expiry. This increases the risk; hence, the margin required to hold these contracts goes up as we get closer to expiry. According to regulations,  Find below our policy on physically settled stock F&O contracts that have details on how the margins change and the action we take in the absence of full margins or stock.Did you know?If a force closure of any F&O contract occurs due to corporate actions like a merger or demerger, 100% margin will be required on the day when the F&O contract expires.Futures and Short Option (Calls & Puts) positions.The margin requirement for all stock futures and short options contracts increases on the expiry day to 50% of the contract value or 1.5 times NRML margin (whichever is lower).The additional margin increase will be reflected in theExposure marginfield on the Kite funds page. This increased margin requirement on the expiry day is updated on Zerodha's margin calculator(WEB)and on the order window.Long/Buy option⁶ (Calls & Puts) positions.When clients pay a small premium of the contract value to buy stock options, they may have to take or deliver stocks worth the entire contract value after the expiration date. The risk of an option buyer defaulting goes up significantly. Hence, exchanges start asking for physical delivery margins from 4 days before the expiry, which keeps increasing as the contract gets closer to expiry. This margin is a percentage of the exchange risk margins(VaR+ELM +Adhoc)⁵, as explained in the table below. These margins are only applicable for In the money (ITM) contracts. The delivery margin is also applied if an Out of the money (OTM) position becomes ITM. The delivery margin will reflect on the funds page on Kite.Our margin policyDay (BOD-Beginning of the day)Margins applicableE-4 Day (Friday)10% of VaR + ELM +Adhoc marginsE-3 Day (Monday)25% of VaR + ELM +Adhoc marginsE-2 Day (Tuesday)45% of VaR + ELM +Adhoc marginsE-1 Day (Wednesday)25% of the contract valueExpiry Day (Thursday)50% of the contract valueHolding positions without the exchange stipulated physical delivery margin (including long options) can lead to margin penalties.³If margin obligations are not met within the given timeframe, positions may be squared off. In such cases, any resulting losses from the square off will be the sole responsibility of the client. If, for any reason, Zerodha's RMS team is unable to square off a position due to margin shortfall, it may result in compulsory physical delivery. In such situations, the client will bear the costs and risks associated with the physical delivery.Stock receivable positions (Take delivery)Holding a “take delivery” position post expiry without sufficient funds in the trading account will lead to the account going in debit. An interest of 0.05% is charged on the debit balance. This can also mean that the stock will be sold by our RMS team to make good of the debit balance in the account.Stock deliverable positions (Give delivery)⁷In the case of short futures, short calls, and long puts where clients are required to give delivery of the stock post expiry, stock available in the demat account is debited towards meeting the exchange obligations including pledged holdings. If the stock is not present in the demat account on the expiry day, the client has the option to purchase the stock on the same day, and this purchase will be counted as part of the stock deliverable position to be netted off. This is in accordance with regulatory requirements(WEB),as obligations for the physical settlement of the F&O segment at a specific expiry are to be offset against obligations in the capital market segment on the corresponding trading date. If a non-DDPI/POA account holder fails to authorise the sale of securities for a physically settled F&O position, the shares are temporarily blocked and may not display in Kite holdings. The shares will be unblocked post market hours on Expiry + 1 day. To learn more, seeWhy did Zerodha send an email to authorise holdings?Non-availability of stock in the demat account will lead to short delivery and auction penalty. To avoid the auction penalty, clients can still buy the stocks in the post-market session. To learn more about post-market session, seeWhat are pre-market and post-market sessions and orders in NSE and BSE?All give delivery positions require clients to have stocks in the demat account in the expiry day.⁴ If any OTM position turns ITM leading to a give delivery position post expiry without sufficient stocks in demat, this will lead to short delivery and auction penalties.Spread and covered contracts.If a client hold multiple F&O positions in the same stock and if the overall position in the account results in an equal quantity of both, give and take delivery, they are netted off¹. So for example an equal number of lots of long futures (take delivery) and short ITM calls (give delivery) on expiry will lead to no delivery obligations as both positions are netted off.While the net delivery obligation could be zero because of the various opposing F&O positions in the same stock, the delivery margins are still charged on each F&O position separately. So if a client had an equal quantity of short futures and long calls, the delivery margin would be asked separately for both the futures and calls contracts. The delivery margin exists because a client can exit one of the positions which can, in turn, lead to a delivery obligation.Buy/Sell price of the physically settled stocksFor all stocks that get credited or debited due to physical delivery of F&O, the expiry day is considered as the trade day. The buying or selling price will be as shown below:Futures:The settlement price of the futures contract on the expiry date.Options:The strike price of the contract.F&O P&L for physically settled contractsFutures:For all positions that are held till expiry, the settlement price of the futures contract is used as the exit price.Options:All ITM stock options that are held till the expiry are exercised. The exit price used is 0 for the P&L, as the stock delivery happens at the strike price.Notes¹A higher brokerage of 0.25% of the total value of physical delivery is charged due to the additional effort. For all netted-off positions(spread contracts, iron condor, etc.), the brokerage will be charged at 0.1% of the physically settled value.²All physically settled contracts, like stock delivery trades, will carry an STT levy of 0.1% of the contract value for both the buyer and the seller of the contract.³Interest will be charged at 0.05% per day if Zerodha account results in a negative balance when the exchange stipulated delivery margins are applicable from 5 days before the expiry (including long ITM options positions)⁴Stocks delivered through physical delivery can be sold on the T+1 day from the expiry day when the stock is delivered to the demat. In case the counterparty defaults to give delivery, the credits of shares from physical delivery post-auction may take up to T+2 days.⁵VaR +ELM +Adhoc (Exchange risk) margins- The stock-wise margin percentages can be found in this sheet.⁶ New buy positions, i.e. fresh long positions, will be blocked on Wednesday and Thursday for OTM stock option contracts of the current month's expiry.⁷ Depending on the liquidity, Zerodha might attempt to buy stocks during the post-market session to partially or fully net off the physical delivery obligation if the client's account doesn't have enough funds or securities.⁸ Zerodha may square off OTM strikes that are closer to the Last Traded Price (LTP) as they may turn to ITM, resulting in physical delivery. Up to three OTM strikes from the LTP can be subject to square-off.This policy may be changed at the discretion of the RMS team.Related articlesWhat are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?Why is higher than usual margin blocked for my F&O trades close to expiry?Can a trading account be opened without opening a demat account?If an F&O position results in taking delivery of the stock, when will the stocks show up on Kite?What happens if the option contract is not squared off on the expiry date?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is higher than usual margin blocked for my F&O trades close to expiry?
Content: Why is higher than usual margin blocked for my F&O trades close to expiry?As Futures and Options (F&O) contracts near their expiry date and approach physical delivery, the margins required for these contracts are increased in proportion to the contract value. This is because physical settlement requires the actual delivery of the underlying stock. Therefore, higher margins are blocked for F&O trades as they get closer to their expiry date.Margins blocked for F&O trades increase:Four days before expiry (previous week Friday to expiry day) in case of open in-the-money(ITM) long options positions.On the expiry day, if any open future or short option positions are required to be physically settled.

Title: What is Value at Risk (VAR), Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), and Adhoc margins?
Content: What is Value at Risk (VAR), Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), and Adhoc margins?Value at Risk (VAR)is a statistical measure used in risk management to estimate the potential loss in value of a portfolio of assets due to market movements over a certain time period and with a certain level of confidence. VAR is commonly used in financial risk management, which helps estimate a portfolio's potential downside risk.Extreme Loss Margin (ELM)is an additional margin charged by exchanges in addition to the normal margin requirements. ELM is designed to cover the risk of losses beyond the level predicted by VAR models. ELM is usually a fixed percentage of the value of the contract and is applied to both buy and sell positions.Adhoc marginsrefer to additional margins that can be imposed by exchanges on market participants on an ad hoc basis. These margins are applied when the exchange perceives that there is a higher risk of default, volatility, or other market conditions that could lead to higher losses. Adhoc margins are typically imposed in addition to the normal margin requirements and are designed to protect the market and its participants from unexpected risks.In Zerodha, the entire margin is required upfront for the equity delivery trades. For intraday, margin requirements are mentioned in Zerodha’s margin calculator(WEB).Adhoc margins are denoted asDelivery marginon Kite funds page. To learn more, seeWhat does the "delivery margin" field on Zerodha Kite mean?Due to upfront margin requirements, any insufficient margin (VAR+ELM+Adhoc) may lead to a margin penalty.

However, there may be differences between the validation and execution prices. This can happen in various scenarios. For instance, a market order for 1000 quantities of a Bank Nifty CE contract requiring a margin of ₹96,150 can be executed at a different price if the contract opens at a different price than the previous close price of ₹96.15, say ₹196.15, leading to a debit of ₹1,96,150 in Zerodha account.Also, cash market or F&O orders placed at the market opening are validated based on the available bid-ask, but the execution can take place at an uncontrollable price. Such circumstances can result in a negative fund balance in Zerodha's account, and Zerodha may square off the positions without prior notice in such cases.Related articlesWhy is the balance in the funds statement displayed as negative?When shares are pledged and collateral margin is received, a debit balance is reflected in the funds statement.

Content: Can long-dated contracts be traded in Zerodha?The expiries allowed in NRML and MIS for F&O contracts in Zerodha can be found here.(DOC)Zerodha allows trading in long-dated contracts, but clients must check the liquidity of the option contract by examining the market depth before trading. In case the stock is illiquid, there is a high risk for clients if the market moves against their position and there is no counterparty to exit the loss-making position. Moreover, for illiquid contracts, there is a possibility of order execution at a price away from the option's theoretical price, which may require clients to provide additional margins to cover their losses. Failure to do so may result in the broker being held responsible as per regulations. The below nudge is displayed to inform clients about long-dated contracts.Market orders can lead to considerable fluctuations in contract prices, posing regulatory implications for brokers. Therefore, market orders are blocked. Zerodha blocks trading in near-month and far-month stock option contracts if the last traded price (LTP) and open interest are zero.

Title: What is Mark to Market (MTM)?
Content: What is Mark to Market (MTM)?MTM or mark-to-market in futures is a process of revaluing open futures contracts at the end of each trading day to determine the profit or loss that has occurred due to changes in the price of the underlying asset. The mark-to-market process involves calculating the difference between the contract's entry price and the contract's current market price and settling the profit or loss in the trader's account. This is done to ensure that traders have enough margin in their Zerodha account to cover the potential losses from their open positions.After the trading hours, the MTM calculations are performed daily based on the day's closing price. On the same day, the P&L is settled to the trading account and will not be reflected in the positions on the following day.The values of the futures contract position are calculated as follows:The change in the value of a futures contract can be calculated as the difference between the futures contract price of the current day and the closing price of the prior day.The P&L for the day can be calculated by multiplying the price change in the futures contract value by the number of lots.The total P&L can be obtained by summing up all the daily P&L until the futures contract position is held.Example ScenarioBuy price - ₹100.Sell price - ₹102.Lot Size - 9500.Profit on the trade: ₹102 - ₹100 = ₹2.Total Profit: 9500 * ₹2 = ₹19,000.While the above gives the overall P&L, let’s apply MTM for the same position as a table. Assume the closing prices of SAIL for the 4 days are 101, 100, 101.5, and 102.3.DayRef price for MTM (a)Closing price (b)Profit and loss (b-a)Daily MTM (P&L * Lot size)1100101195002101100-1-95003100101.51.514250Sum of the MTM for the first three days14250MTM on the fourth day is calculated as follows:DayThe reference price for MTMSell priceClosing priceProfit (Sell price - reference price for MTM)Profit (0.5 * Lot size)4101.5102102.3102 - 101.5 = 0.50.5 * 9500= 4750Total P&L: 14250 (Sum of the MTM of the first three days) + 4750 (P&L of the 4th day) = 19000.Two reference values are available - ₹101.5 as the previous day's close, i.e. 3rd day's close, and ₹102 as the price at which the position was squared off. The sum of the daily MTM leads to the same P&L tally, i.e. ₹19,000 profit. From day 4 onwards, any changes in the contract price will not impact the P&L after selling the contract at ₹102. The profit of ₹4,750, adhering to the selling price of ₹102, will be credited to the trading account by the end of the day.Did you know?MTM calculation is applicable only for future contracts and not for options or equity stocks.MTM is updated on a live basis but will reflect in the ledger only at the end of the day.The MTM realised P/L for a closed position will not reflect in Kite during the day but will be updated in your console ledger at the end of the day. It will reflect on Kite the next day.If the position is in loss and there is insufficient balance in the account, the position may be squared off, and a margin penalty will be levied.If the security is not traded on a particular day, the latest available closing price is considered for MTM.MTM losses on positions will show up as unrealised profit in Kite until squared off.To learn more about MTM, visitzerodha.com/varsity/chapter/margin-m2m.Related articlesWhy does P&L in Kite positions not match with gains on the funds page?Why does Kite P&L not match with credit/debit on Console?How to understand the credit/debit on funds statement when trading F&O?What are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?What does settlement cycle mean?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is a margin penalty, and why is it charged?
Content: What is a margin penalty, and why is it charged?A margin penalty is a charge imposed for failing to maintain sufficient margin in a trading account. Clients are required by exchanges to maintain adequate margins for their trades and to transfer funds in the event of a margin shortfall, which means a deficit of funds or margin in the trading account.There are two types of margin penalties:1. Upfront margin penaltyUpfront margin refers to the margin that must be provided in order to initiate a trade. The broker will be charged an upfront margin penalty if the trader doesn't have sufficient margin in their account when entering a trade.Example scenarioIf the broker lets a trader enter a position with a minimum margin of ₹1.1 lakh (SPAN + Exposure), but the trader only has ₹1 lakh in their account, there will be a shortfall of ₹10,000, resulting in a penalty being imposed on that amount.2. Non-upfront margin penaltyNon-upfront margin pertains to the margins that should be fulfilled by the client after initiating a trade, following the fulfilment of the upfront margin requirement. If the client fails to provide the required funds within the deadline, it leads to a deficit and may result in a penalty. If there are marked-to-market (MTM) losses in futures contracts, the client has until T+1 day till 11.59 PM to add the funds. Failure to do so is considered a non-upfront margin deficit and can lead to a penalty. Additionally, ad-hoc margin requirements added by exchanges owing to volatility or physical delivery margins to stock F&O contracts in the last week of expiry are also deemed non-upfront margins. If a penalty is charged for non-upfront margins, the corresponding fund statement entry will be posted on the T+6th day, as margin reporting is due on T+5 days.Visittradingqna.com/t/nse-circular-on-short-margin-penalty-refund/136203/26for more detailed examples of upfront and non-upfront margin penalties.Related articlesWhat are the different types of margins charged by the exchange?What is Value at Risk (VAR), Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), and Adhoc margins?What is a daily margin statement, and how to understand it?Will brokerage and taxes be considered when margins are blocked for trades in the commodity segment?How to place basket orders on Kite?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Clients must maintain sufficient margins in their accounts for their trades and transfer additional funds if there is a margin shortfall, which occurs when there is insufficient funds or margin in the account. To learn more about the margin penalty, seeWhat is a margin penalty, and why is it charged?The penalty levied in the case of a shortfall can be:Shortfall collection for each clientPenalty percentage of the shortfall(< ₹1 lakh) And (< 10% of applicable margin)0.5%(>= ₹1 lakh) Or (>= 10% of applicable margin)1.0%If the margin shortfall continues for more than 3 consecutive days, a penalty of 5% is applied for each subsequent instance of the margin shortfall.If there are more than 5 instances of shortfall in a calendar month, a penalty of 5% for every further instance of the shortfall.For MCX, if the margin shortfall is reported 3 times or more during a month, i.e., in consecutive instances or 3 different instances, the penalty would be 5% from the 4th instance of the shortfall.GST at 18% is levied on the penalty amount.Learn more about margin penalties by visiting NSE(WEB)and MCX(WEB).If a margin penalty is incurred, the due date for reporting margins to the exchange is T+5 days. Zerodha posts the entry on the funds statement once the exchange receives the penalty file, i.e., on T+6 day. It is posted in the statement on Console with the narration"{segment}} short-margin penalty (non-upfront) for date yyyy-mm-dd”Related articlesHow to verify if Zerodha has passed the margin penalty to the exchange?What is a margin penalty, and why is it charged?How much penalty/What’s the rate of penalty levied by the Exchange?Why have I been charged margin penalty?What is Value at Risk (VAR), Extreme Loss Margin (ELM), and Adhoc margins?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are margins and how can margin shortfall occur?
Content: What are margins and how can margin shortfall occur?SEBI requires brokers to collect margins from clients before executing orders to cover potential losses. If clients fail to maintain adequate margins, a margin shortfall occurs. The margin shortfall is the difference between the required margin by SEBI and the available margin in the form of funds or collateral. Several factors can affect the margin amount needed for a trade, including liquidity, volatility, time to expiry for futures and options contracts, and other positions in the portfolio.The margin required to enter into a trade can be checked on the order window:Even after the execution of the order, the margin required for the open positions can still change. The breakup of the funds balances and margin utilised can be tracked on the Kite funds page.Common instances of margin shortfallThe margins for all trades are required to be collected upfront for both F&O and equity trades. To learn more about upfront margin, visittradingqna.com/t/changes-in-margin-requirements-from-1st-sep-2020/88915The following are a few typical scenarios that may cause a margin shortfall and subsequent penalties:EquityIntraday trade is not squared-offIf an intraday trade cannot be squared off, it can result in a buy or sell delivery obligation. For sell obligations where there are no holdings, an auction settlement and associated penalties may occur. To learn more, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?If there is a buy delivery obligation, and there is insufficient balance to take delivery, the broker may close the position. This could lead to a margin shortfall if the funds available are insufficient to cover both the initial trade's margin requirements and the next day's square-off transaction.F&OIncrease in margin requirement due to shuffling of positionsThe margin requirements for F&O trading are based on SPAN and Exposure margins. The SPAN margin is calculated on the overall F&O positions held, and certain positions that reduce portfolio risk may lead to a lower margin requirement. However, if these positions are closed without closing other open trades, the margin requirement can increase.For instance, buying one lot of NIFTY futures and one lot of NIFTY put option of 17000 strike price had a margin requirement of ₹44.64 thousand. But if the put option is squared off before exiting the futures trade, the margin requirement can increase to ₹1.08 lakhs, resulting in a margin shortfall if there aren’t enough funds in the Zerodha account.Incremental physical delivery margins not maintainedIn the past, F&O positions that were held until expiration were settled in cash based on the underlying stock price. But as of October 2019, the settlement process has been updated to involve giving or taking delivery of the actual shares. If one purchases option contracts, there is no need to maintain SPAN and exposure margin in their account since the margin requirement is limited to the value of the option, as the risk is also limited to that amount.However, in-the-money (ITM) options are now settled by delivery of the underlying shares due to new physical delivery rules. The Exchange levies physical delivery margins from four days prior to expiration for ITM options as a percentage of the applicable margins (VAR + ELM + Adhoc) of the underlying stock in a particular manner:Day (Beginning of the day)Margins applicableE-4 Day (Friday BOD)10% of VaR + ELM + Adhoc marginsE-3 Day (Monday BOD)25% of VaR + ELM + Adhoc marginsE-2 Day (Tuesday BOD)45% of VaR + ELM + Adhoc marginsE-1 Day (Wednesday BOD)70% VaR + ELM + Adhoc marginsTo learn more about the physical settlement, visitzerodha.com/varsity/chapter/quick-note-on-physical-settlement-2Both Equity and F&OEnd of Day (EOD) margins are not maintainedThe exchanges release margin files several times a day, with the final file published at 5:30 PM reflecting any movement in the stock during market close hours. The End of Day (EOD) file is updated accordingly with the latest margins. The displayed margin requirement on Kite is based on the most recent exchange file available, meaning it can change after market hours based on the EOD file.To avoid a margin shortfall, keeping sufficient funds in the Zerodha account above the margin requirement is recommended, with a buffer of 5% being sufficient on most days if there aren't significant price changes.Sell holdings and buy them back on the same day but meanwhile use the funds for another intraday or F&O tradeWhen selling holdings, 80% of the selling credit can be used for new trades. If this credit is used for intraday trade and the holdings are bought back, a margin shortfall can occur if there isn't enough margin separately available for the intraday or F&O trades.Example ScenarioA credit of ₹8,000 will be available for new trades by selling shares worth ₹10,000 from the holdings.If a trade requiring a margin of ₹5,000 was taken and squared off, and the holdings were repurchased with the credit, the peak margin requirement for the day would be ₹7,000 [i.e. ₹5,000 + 20% of ₹10,000], but only shares worth ₹2,000/- would be eligible for margin.A penalty will be levied if there aren’t sufficient funds in the Zerodha account.To learn more about peak margin, visitzerodha.com/z-connect/zerodha/bulletin-latest-at-zerodha/peak-margin-intraday-leverages-2nd-order-effects-dec-1st-2020.Penalty structureMargin penalty is charged on the shortfall amount (difference between margin available and margin required) at the following rates:Shortfall amountPenalty Percentage(< Rs 1 lakh) And (< 10% of applicable margin)0.5%(= Rs 1 lakh) Or (= 10% of applicable margin)1.0%If the shortfall continues for more than 3 consecutive days, a penalty of 5% is applied on the amount for each subsequent instance. Similarly, if there are more than 5 instances of margin shortfall in a month, the penalty charged is 5% of the shortfall amount beyond the 5th day.GST is charged at 18% on the entire penalty amount.

Title: Can exiting one leg of a hedged position lead to a peak margin shortfall?
Content: Can exiting one leg of a hedged position lead to a peak margin shortfall?Exiting a hedged trade's low-risk leg is a common reason for peak margin shortfall. These shortfalls can occur despite a client having closed both legs of a hedged trade.The clearing corporation (CC) takes four random snapshots of all intraday positions and margins across customers during the day to determine whether sufficient margins are available during those snapshots. If sufficient margins aren’t available either at the end of the trading day or in the intraday snapshots, a margin penalty is charged on the net shortfall amount. The penalty is 0.5% of the shortfall amount lower than ₹1 lakh and 1% for higher than ₹1 lakh. This can go up to 5% in the case of shortfall for more than three instances in a month. A peak margin shortfall can occur if a snapshot is taken when one leg of the trade is closed and the other is yet to be closed.Example ScenarioMr X transfers ₹2,00,000/- to the trading account and takes a NIFTY long position in the April contract, the margin blocked is ₹1,60,000/-Mr X takes a NIFTY short position in the May contract. The margin blocked is now ₹30,000/- (on account of the position currently being hedged; free balance in account: ₹1,70,000/-)Mr X takes a BANKNIFTY long position in the April contract. The margin blocked is ₹1,60,000/-In this case, Mr X has fulfilled all margin requirements.Mr X now closes the first leg of the NIFTY position (long April), as a result of which the total margin required in the account goes up to ₹3,20,000/-The system of a trading member raises an alert and informs the client of short margins. NSE takes a snapshot of the position at this instance and captures ₹3,20,000/- as the margin required.The client, on receipt of an alert from the trading member, closes the other leg of NIFTY, as a result of which the margin required drops to ₹1,60,000/- (Since only the BANKNIFTY position is open)There is a peak margin shortfall despite the client having squared off the outstanding positions and complying with the margin requirements on an end-of-day basis.To learn more about margin penalties, seezerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/margins-margin-penalties-when-trading-with-leverage.Did you know?A brokerage of ₹40 per executed order will be charged instead of ₹20 while placing an F&O order if the Zerodha account has a negative balance.Related articlesWill there be a peak margin penalty if a loss is made due to a freak trade?What are margins and how can margin shortfall occur?What changes due to the new upfront margin requirements?Why is full credit not being received against the sell value of the holdings?Why have I been charged margin penalty?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What will happen to my intraday (MIS/CO) position in case the stock circuit limits are hit?
Content: What will happen to my intraday (MIS/CO) position in case the stock circuit limits are hit?An intraday (MIS/CO) order allows traders to use leverage to enter buy or sell trades, with the potential to trade up to 5 times the available funds in their account. With these orders, traders can buy stocks with more funds than they have or sell stocks without actually holding them in their demat account. However, it's important to note that intraday trades must be squared off on the same day. To learn more about auto square-off timings, seeWhat are the auto square-off timings for open intraday positions?If traders fail to square off an intraday position, Zerodha will attempt to square off the positions on their behalf before the market closes. It's crucial to be aware that trading with MIS/CO orders carries additional risks, apart from the potential loss due to leverage. There is a possibility that traders may not be able to square off their positions if the stock hits the upper or lower circuit limit. This can result in significant overnight and auction risks associated with leveraged positions. To learn more about circuit limits, seeWhat are circuit limits or price bands?If there is an open sell intraday position, the stock hits the upper circuit limit.When a stock hits the upper circuit price, there are only buyers in the market, and no sellers are available. This means that it becomes difficult to repurchase the stock that was initially sold for intraday trading. As a result, the intraday trade automatically converts into a delivery trade.Here is a screenshot of Reliance Capital trading at the upper circuit for the day:If the stock is held in the demat account, it will be transferred to the exchange. However, if the shares are not available, there will be a situation of short delivery or default on the sell trade. Exchanges conduct auctions to purchase the shares on behalf of the seller and deliver them to the buyer of the sell trade on T+2. This may result in an auction penalty based on the settlement price. Additionally, an amount equivalent to 120% of the closing price on the date of the sell trade will be blocked in the account with the narration "Short delivery margin blocked for sale of <scrip name>" until the auction is completed. To learn more, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?If there is an open buy intraday position, the stock hits the lower circuit limit.When a stock hits the lower circuit price, there are only sellers in the market, and no buyers are available. This means that it becomes difficult to sell the stock that was initially bought for intraday trading. As a result, the intraday trade automatically converts into a delivery trade. Here is a screenshot of ADANI POWER trading at the lower circuit for the day:If sufficient funds are available in the Zerodha account, the stock will be delivered to the demat account. However, if there are insufficient funds, the client has two options. They can either add the required funds to complete the transaction or sell their existing holdings to the extent of the required funds. Failure to take either of these actions will result in Zerodha selling the stock to cover the required funds.Related articlesWhy is the circuit limit showing differently on Kite after the stocks circuit limit has already been hit?What are circuit limits or price bands?Why is the order pending on Kite?Why did Zerodha send an email to authorise holdings?How to use the Good Till Triggered (GTT) feature?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Content: Why are intraday (MIS/CO) orders not allowed for some stocks?Intraday (MIS/CO) orders are not allowed for some stocks due to regulatory or risk management reasons. These types of orders provide leverage, allowing traders to trade with more funds than they have in their Zerodha account. However, stockbrokers may restrict intraday orders for certain stocks to mitigate potential risks. In such cases, traders can only place delivery (CNC) orders for those particular stocks. To learn more about product types, seeWhat does CNC, MIS and NRML mean?Intraday orders may be blocked due to the high risk of being unable to exit the intraday position, which can potentially lead to short delivery in certain situations. To learn more about short delivery, seeWhat is short delivery and what are its consequences?There are several reasons why intraday orders can be blocked, including:Volatile markets or sudden movements:During periods of high volatility, specific intraday order types (MIS/CO) may be blocked to prevent clients from incurring losses beyond their available account funds and to mitigate credit risk for the broker.Low liquidity or volume:If a stock has low liquidity or trading volume, intraday orders may be blocked to ensure that there is sufficient market depth for smooth order execution.Small circuit limit range:Intraday orders can be blocked for stocks with a small circuit limit range to avoid excessive price fluctuations and potential market manipulation. To learn more about circuit limits, seeWhat are circuit limits or price bands?IPO listing day:On the day of an initial public offering (IPO) listing, when market volatility is typically high, intraday orders may be blocked to manage risk and protect investors.High margin requirement and potential margin penalty:Stocks with high margin requirements may have intraday trading blocked to avoid margin penalties that may be incurred due to inadequate margin coverage. To learn more about margin penalty, seeWhat is a margin penalty, and why is it charged?Regulatory restrictions:Stocks categorized as Trade-to-Trade(WEB),ASM (Additional Surveillance Measures)(WEB),GSM (Graded Surveillance Measures)(WEB),or Unsolicited SMS category are blocked from intraday trading due to regulatory restrictions.Intraday orders can be blocked for any instrument based on Zerodha's policy.

Title: Why was the limit order executed at the market price instead of the specified limit price?
Content: Why was the limit order executed at the market price instead of the specified limit price?A limit order enables clients to purchase or sell a stock at a specific price or a better price. In simpler terms, when placing a buy limit order, the order will execute at the limit price or a lower price, but not at a higher price. Likewise, a sell limit order will execute at the limit price or a higher price, but not at a lower price.Example scenarioIn the below screenshot, the LTP of SBIN is 185.40; the best bid and offer are at 185.35 and 185.40, respectively.When a limit buy order is placed at 190, and there is a sell offer at 185.40, the stock will be purchased at the lower price of ₹185.40. This means that the stock is acquired for ₹4.60 less than the intended purchase price.Similarly, if a limit sell order is placed at 180 and there is a bid to buy at 185.35, the order will be executed at the higher price of ₹185.35. As a result, the seller receives ₹5.35 more than the asking price.This is how the exchange matching engine operates, ensuring that trades are executed at the most advantageous prices available.What if someone wanted to purchase solely at 190 or sell exclusively at 180 in the previous example?Trigger orders can be used to sell at a specific price. With trigger orders, the actual orders are not directly placed on the exchange matching engine. Instead, a trigger price is set, and if the last traded price reaches or surpasses the trigger price, the actual order is executed.Zerodha provides two types of trigger orders:Good till triggered (GTT) orders - validity up to 1 year. To learn more, seeWhat is the Good Till Triggered (GTT) feature?Stoploss orders that can be used as trigger orders - valid only for the day. To learn more, seeWhat are stop loss orders and how to use them?Instead of using a limit order, a client could choose a GTT (Good Till Triggered) or SL (Stop-Loss) order to purchase the stock either at a limit of 190 or at the prevailing market price with a trigger of 190. This means that when the stock price hits 190, the trigger condition is satisfied, and the client's order to buy at 190 is executed. Likewise, the client can place a selling limit or market order with a trigger price of 180 to sell the stock.Related articlesWhy is a nudge displayed saying that the order price is x% above or below the Last Traded Price (LTP)?How to use limit order as a market order?Why is the error 'Trigger price can’t be higher than price' or 'Trigger price can’t be lesser than price' displayed while placing a stop loss order?What are the different order types available on Kite and how are they executed?How to use limit orders as market orders?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are limit and market orders?
Content: What are limit and market orders?Limit orders are used to buy or sell an instrument at a specific price.Example scenarioBuy limit orderAssume the Current Market Price (CMP) of a share is ₹95.Client wishes to buy when the price drops to ₹90.A buy limit order can be placed at ₹90 and the stock will be bought at ₹90 or lower.Sell limit orderAssume the Current Market Price (CMP) of a share is ₹95.If a client wishes to sell the share when the price is ₹100.A sell limit order can be placed at ₹100 and the stock will be sold at ₹100 or higher.The advantage of a limit order is that the share is bought at the desired price. However, depending on the availability of a counter order for the specified quantity or price, the order may not be completely filled, resulting in partial execution.Did you know?Limit orders placed at ₹0 are rejected on Kite.Limit orders can be executed as market orders.

Title: Why did the limit order not execute even though the share price matched the order price?
Content: Why did the limit order not execute even though the share price matched the order price?Exchanges use a principle called price-time priority to handle orders and quotes. When an order is submitted, it receives a timestamp that determines its priority. Orders are then executed based on the order in which they were received, following a first come, first served basis.In the case of a limit order, even if the share price matches the order price, it may not be executed if there are multiple bids at the same price and only one offer to match them. The order that was placed first will be given priority and executed, while the others will be processed afterwards.Related articlesWhat are the different order types available on Kite and how are they executed?Why isn't the order getting executed even though it has been placed successfully?Why is a nudge displayed saying that the order price is x% above or below the Last Traded Price (LTP)?How to use limit orders as market orders?How will NSE’s self-trade prevention mechanism affect Cover Orders?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are cover orders and how to use them?
Content: What are cover orders and how to use them?A Cover Order (CO) is an order with an in-built risk mitigation mechanism. A cover order combines a market order or limit order with a stop loss order, ensuring that the maximum potential loss is known in advance if the trade moves against the trader. The purpose of cover orders is to reduce the risk for both the broker and the trader while also allowing the trader to leverage their positions more effectively.A cover order consists of either a market or limit order placed along with a mandatory stop loss order within a specified range. The inherent risk is automatically reduced by placing the stop loss order simultaneously with the contract. Cover orders are applicable only for intraday trading, and any open intraday positions will be automatically squared-off by the system if not closed within the stipulated timings. To learn more, seeWhat are the auto square-off timings for open intraday positions?Did you know?The stop loss order cannot be cancelled once placed, as it is an integral part of the cover order.Cover orders are not permitted on the BSE and across F&O segments.Cover orders can only be exited from the order book.When placing a buy cover order, ensure the limit price is higher than the stop-loss trigger price. When placing a sell cover order, the limit price should be lower than the stop loss trigger price. The stop-loss trigger price is allowed within a range of 10% when placing a cover order.If one leg of the cover order is rejected/cancelled for any reason, clients will need to contact our support desk over the phone to square off the position.

Title: Why was the stop-loss order executed even though the price did not breach the trigger?
Content: Why was the stop-loss order executed even though the price did not breach the trigger?We get this query quite often, “my limit/market/stoploss order was executed, but the price at which it is executed doesn’t show up on the charts. How is that possible?”Firstly, you need to be aware that it is technologically impossible for a chart offered by a broker (irrespective of which broker) to show all trades that are executed at an exchange today. Here is why:Lakhs of people are executing tens of thousands of trades on the exchange every single second. Trades on a single stock happen within microsecond intervals at the exchanges, and exponentially more on volatile days. The charts that you see on Kite (or at any other broker) are formed using the data feed streamed by the exchanges. These feeds of “ticks” are combined snapshots of many such trades over larger intervals, for instance, one to four times every second, that is, all the trades over a minimum of 250 milliseconds. The charts are formed using those four ticks and not the thousands of ticks or trades that happen on the exchange. So there is no way the chart can show all trades.Why can’t exchanges send all trades to the broker?The data feed including every single trade that happens at the exchange every microsecond is known as the Tick By Tick (TBT) feed. Because it is enormous amounts of data, impossible to efficiently send over the internet or leased lines.This issue of not being able to see a certain price on the chart typically happens when a large order moves the price for a few microseconds which may not get captured in the exchange snapshot transmitted to the broker. Like I said above, there is no technical way to solve this issue today. Maybe in a few years from now when internet bandwidth available is exponentially more than what it is today, we could get exchange feeds with every single trade. This issue exists at all the international exchanges as well.Execution priceEvery single order that is placed, be it market, limit, or SL etc., is immediately transmitted by the broker to the exchange in real time. The actual filling or the execution of the order happens at the exchange. Any price that an order fills it, is filled by the exchange centrally. Brokers have zero involvement or control on order matching and execution at the exchange.If there is an exchange trade ID, that means that trade is executed at the exchange. You can also verify this using theNSE trade verification module.What if I want to see all the ticks or trades?Exchanges give a colocation service where you can have your servers within the exchange premises and consume the premium Tick by Tick data stream offered by the exchange. You have to consume these feeds within exchange premises over LAN and not internet. You would have to then build a program to consume many GB’s worths of raw data and convert it into an intelligent format and consume it right there on the co-located server because it will not be possible to stream it out over the internet. Check morehereand pricinghere.TBT data is used mainly by high-frequency trading desks. It is not meant for retail customers and is prohibitively expensive, and as explained above, impossible to transfer over the internet anyway.Related articlesWhy is the error 'Trigger price can’t be higher than price' or 'Trigger price can’t be lesser than price' displayed while placing a stop loss order?How will NSE’s self-trade prevention mechanism affect Cover Orders?How to use Stoploss-limit(SL) order like a Stoploss-Market(SLM) order?How to use the Good Till Triggered (GTT) feature?Why was the stop loss order triggered without the trigger price being hit as per the charts?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are stop loss orders and how to use them?
Content: What are stop loss orders and how to use them?A stop-loss order is a buy/sell order placed to limit losses when there is a concern that prices may move against the trade. For instance, if a stock is purchased at ₹100 and the loss is to be limited at ₹95, an order can be placed to sell the stock as soon as its price reaches ₹95. Such an order is known as a 'Stop Loss' as it aims to prevent a loss exceeding the predetermined risk.There are two types of Stop-Loss orders:SL order (Stop-Loss Limit) = Price + Trigger Price.SL-M order (Stop-Loss Market) = Only Trigger Price.Example ScenarioCase 1: A sell SL is maintained if there is a buy position.Case 2: A buy SL is maintained if there is a sell position.In Case 1, for a buy position at ₹100 with an SL set at ₹95:a. SL-M order type: A Sell SL-M order is placed with a trigger price of ₹95. When the price reaches ₹95, a sell market order is sent to the exchange, and the position is squared off at the prevailing market price.b. SL order type: A Sell SL order is placed with a price and trigger price. The trigger price must be greater than or equal to the price. This order type allows for a range of the Stop-Loss. For instance, a trigger price of ₹95 and a price of ₹94.90 can be set. When the trigger price of ₹95 is reached, a sell limit order is sent to the exchange, and the order is squared off at the next available bid above ₹94.90. Thus, the SL order may be executed at ₹95 (or higher) or ₹94.95 but not below ₹94.90.The disadvantage of this order type is that if the market sharply declines and the stock price is already below ₹94.90 when the trigger of ₹95 is reached, the Stop-Loss order remains open, potentially resulting in higher losses. It is important to exercise discretion in choosing between SL and SL-M orders based on the market scenario.In Case 2, for a sell position at ₹100 with an SL set at ₹105:a. SL-M order type: A Buy SL-M order is placed with a trigger price of ₹105. When the price reaches ₹105, a buy market order is sent to the exchange, and the position is squared off at the prevailing market price.b. SL order type: A Buy SL order is placed with a price and trigger price. The trigger price must be less than or equal to the price. This order type allows for a range of the stop-loss. For example, a trigger price of ₹105 and a price of ₹105.10 can be set. When the trigger price of ₹105 is reached, a buy limit order is sent to the exchange, and the order is squared off at the next available offer below ₹105.10. Thus, the SL order may be executed at ₹105.05 or ₹105 but not above ₹105.10.Alternatively, SL orders can be used in the following manner:Since Sell SL orders are used below the buy price, and Buy SL orders are used above the sell price, these order types can be utilized to Buy above the Last Traded Price (LTP) and Sell below the LTP.To buy above LTP, a Buy SL order can be placed with the desired purchase price.To sell below LTP, a Sell SL order can be placed with the desired selling price.Did you know?NSE has stopped supporting SL-M order type for options.

Title: How to use Stoploss-limit(SL) order like a Stoploss-Market(SLM) order?
Content: How to use Stoploss-limit(SL) order like a Stoploss-Market(SLM) order?A trade that gets executed at a significantly distant price from the current market price is commonly referred to as afreak trade.These trades usually occur due to shallow market depth, which results in low liquidity. Another factor that can contribute to a freak trade is when a trade coincides with a large market order.Placing a market order inherently carries the risk of potential losses due to a freak trade, while a limit order provides the advantage of price execution at a specified level, thus avoiding a freak trade but without a guarantee of order fill. However, combining the benefits of both order types is possible, allowing for the price protection offered by a limit order (eliminating the risk of a freak trade) while still enjoying the order fill guarantee typically associated with a market order.Use Stoploss limit order as Stoploss market orders.A Stoploss order is a type of order where a trigger price is specified, leading to the placement of either a limit order or market order. These triggers are set within the exchange system, not the broker systems.Similar to using a limit order as a market order, the SL - L (stop loss limit) order can also be used as an SL-M (stop loss market) order. To do this, a limit price needs to be provided, which is higher or lower than the trigger price, depending on whether the intention is to buy or sell.Example ScenarioStock: ITCPosition: ShortShort Price: ₹245CMP: ₹241SL Trigger: ₹248SL Limit: ₹258In this scenario, the SL limit buy order at ₹258 will be placed as soon as the market price reaches the SL trigger price of ₹248. However, since ₹258 is significantly higher than the current market price of ₹241, the limit price essentially functions as a market order and gets filled within the range of ₹248 and ₹258 when the market hits ₹248.In the event that another large market order coincides with your order, the limit price at ₹258 serves as protection against a freak trade, mitigating the risk of unexpected price fluctuations.Similarly, when a SL sell limit order is placed with a price below the current market price, the SL limit order will function as an SL market order.Example ScenarioAssume a long position is held on Nifty 17500 CE with a current price of ₹185.A SL limit sell order is placed at ₹170, triggered at ₹180.Given the current market price of ₹185 and the placement of the SL limit sell order at a lower price, the order will function as a market order and execute immediately.Consequently, all available quantities will be sold for up to ₹170.In the event of a large market order coinciding with the placed order, potentially resulting in a price spike, the limit order ensures protection by restricting the sell price to ₹170.This restriction prevents the sell price from going lower and provides a safeguard against adverse price fluctuations.To learn how to use limit order as a market order, seeHow to use limit order as a market order?Did you know?NSE has stopped supporting SL-M order type for options from Sep 27th 2021.Related articlesWhat does the error 'The order was cancelled by the exchange because the price is outside the current allowed limit price protection range' mean?How will NSE’s self-trade prevention mechanism affect Cover Orders?What are stop loss orders and how to use them?What is an After Market Order (AMO) and how to place it?How to use the Good Till Triggered (GTT) feature?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why did the market order get executed as a limit order?
Content: Why did the market order get executed as a limit order?The market order gets executed as a limit order for all the instruments in BSE and for some illiquid stocks in NSEbecause of the Market Price Protection (MPP)(WEB)enabled by the exchanges. MPP was introduced to reduce the risk of orders being executed at prices far from the Last Traded Price (LTP) due to the bid-ask spread.When a market order is placed onNSE for an illiquid stock, the order will be placed as a limit order or get rejected based on the criteria mentioned by the exchanges.(WEB)When a market order is placed onBSE, it is executed as a limit order. The order will be executed at the next best available bid or offer within 3% of the LTP.Example ScenarioIf a buy market order for DENABANK-BSE with an LTP of ₹12 is placed, a limit order with market protection of 3% will be placed instead, i.e., the order will get executed at the next best offer within ₹12.36.Related articlesHow to use Stoploss-limit(SL) order like a Stoploss-Market(SLM) order?How to use limit order as a market order?Why did the market order in the pre-open session change to a limit order?Why is a nudge displayed saying that the order price is x% above or below the Last Traded Price (LTP)?How to use limit orders as market orders?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Can target and stop-loss orders be placed together for open Futures positions?
Content: Can target and stop-loss orders be placed together for open Futures positions?Placing two orders of the opposite transaction type (buy/sell) for the same instrument is allowed, even if the required margin for the second order is not available, as long as there is a positive cash balance. This applies to both NRML and MIS product types.Example ScenarioAssuming the available balance in the client's trading account is ₹1 lac, the client bought NIFTY futures at 11300, with a margin blocked of ₹96,000.To limit the client's losses at 11275, the client places a stop-loss order at 11275. This exit order does not require any additional margin since it signifies the client's intention to exit their current position.If the client wishes to set a target price at 11350, they can place another sell order to open a new short position at 11350. This is possible only if the client's account's available balance prior to initiating the NIFTY buy was higher than the required margin (i.e., ₹96,000) and they have a positive account balance.The first executed order will be considered the exit order, and the margins blocked for the client's open position will be released.The released margins and the free cash in the client's trading account will be used to open a new position based on their second order.The client should remember to cancel their stop-loss order if their target order is executed, and vice versa. Alternatively, they can use a GTT (Good Till Triggered) order.

Title: How will NSE’s self-trade prevention mechanism affect Cover Orders?
Content: How will NSE’s self-trade prevention mechanism affect Cover Orders?In 2015, the NSE implemented a mechanism to prevent self-trades for clients who have both buy and sell orders open for the same scrip at the same price. Refer to this FAQ(WEB)for more info. To learn more, seeWhat is NSE's self-trade prevention mechanism?In the case of Cover Orders (CO), if a client places a counter order that matches the CO's stop loss or target orders, the position will remain open without any target or stop loss order associated with it.Example ScenarioIf a client places a Buy Cover Order (CO) at the market price, with the Last Traded Price (LTP) at 100, and sets a stop loss at 99 (both orders placed simultaneously at the exchange), the stop loss order will be triggered if the scrip's price falls to 99 before the execution of the first leg.If a CO is left hanging, the client has two options. They can either square it off by placing a counter order to their existing position using the NRML product type, or they can contact the dealer desk at 080 4718 1888 and request the Risk Management Services (RMS) team to cover the position.Did you know?Cover orders are not allowed in the F&O (Futures and Options) segments due to the absence of additional leverage for CO on index options.Related articlesWhat is my BO ID?How to reset the password or view the CDSL easi login name?How to upgrade from Myeasi to Myeasiest?How to add a beneficiary on CDSL to transfer securities?How to freeze or unfreeze the stocks in the demat account?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are Iceberg orders, and how to use them?
Content: What are Iceberg orders, and how to use them?Iceberg is an order type that slices orders of larger quantity (or value) into smaller orders, where each small order, or leg, is sent to the exchange only after the previous order is filled.Iceberg orders only allow limit orders. This helps reduce the impact cost of execution in addition to not revealing large orders in the market depth bids and offers. Icebergs are a very popular order type amongst institutional traders, and Zerodha is excited to introduce this to retail traders in India.What is impact cost?Impact cost represents the difference in the actual traded price compared to the instrument's price when the order was placed. For example, if a market order to buy 1000 shares was placed when the stock was trading at ₹100, and if the actual execution price was ₹100.5, this ₹0.5 x 1000 = ₹500 would be the impact cost for the order. Similarly, if a limit order to buy 1000 shares was placed at ₹100 when the stock was trading at ₹100 and later modified to 100.3 to get a fill, 0.3 x 1000 = ₹300 is technically the impact cost.As the size of the order increases, the impact cost goes up as well. Traders with large order values end up losing a lot more money to impact costs as compared to all other charges combined (STT, Brokerage, exchange transaction, etc).How do Icebergs work?As the name suggests, when a large order is placed, it is divided into smaller orders or legs, and only the first leg is placed on the exchange at first, revealing only the tip of the iceberg. Once this leg is executed, the next leg of the main order is placed, and so on, until the desired quantity is traded. The number of legs is decided by the client.Follow these steps to place an Iceberg order:Click on Iceberg on the order window.SelectIntradayorOvernight.EnterQuantityand thePrice.SelectLimit.Enter theNumber of legsand click onBuyorSell.The maximum number of legs per Iceberg is 10.Example scenarioAn order for Nifty CE of 3000 quantity (60 lots) can be divided into 5 orders of 600 each by selecting the number of legs. This way, every subsequent order of 600 will be executed only once the previous orders are executed.Did you know?Since each leg is a separate order, thebrokerage is charged separately. For instance, if the order is split into 5 legs, then the brokerage will be applicable for 5 executed orders individually.If any leg of an Iceberg is cancelled, all the remaining pending legs that are yet to be placed will be automatically cancelled. Similarly, if the price of any leg of the Iceberg is modified, the new price will automatically be applied to all the pending legs.The minimum order value is ₹1,00,000 for equity and 5 lots for F&O.Iceberg orders are available for NSE equity, NFO (NSE F&O), CDS (NSE currency segment), BSE equity and BFO (BSE F&O) only. Iceberg order type is not available for MCX and BCD yet.Icebergs can’t be used in the case of market and SL-M orders.Iceberg orders and minute validity are not supported during pre-open & post-market sessions.The disclosed quantity feature can be used for equity trades which will work very similar to Icebergs, and the disclosed quantity feature doesn’t create multiple orders and hence won't have any additional costs. Disclosed quantity feature isn’t available for F&O trades.  SeeWhat is disclosed quantity feature and how to use it?Order validity in minutesAlong with DAY (valid for the whole trading day until filled) and IOC (Immediate or Cancel) orders, Zerodha is introducing a new minute validity feature. An order can be set to auto-cancel if it does not complete in a given period of time, and this period is set in minutes.Iceberg orders can be placed with validity in minutes, along with regular orders.Icebergs to overcome order freeze limitsExchanges have a maximum order limit set for equity derivative contracts. The exchanges define the maximum number of contracts that can be bought or sold in a single order as freeze limits.This is an inconvenience to traders who want to execute larger quantities, requiring them to place multiple orders. With Iceberg orders, an order to buy 10000 or 200 lots of Nifty or more can be placed at the same time. This will not only mean not having to place multiple orders in case of a large order but also help reduce impact costs. Freeze quantity limits can be checked underVolume Freeze Quantityon the NSE website(WEB).Related articlesHow to use the basket order feature on Kite app?How to place basket orders on Kite?What does the error 'The quantity is higher than the maximum allowed quantity of xxx' mean?What does the error 'Maximum quantity per order for Equity is 1,00,000' mean?Why does the downloaded order book from Kite display a date instead of the quantity?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What does record date and ex-date mean?
Content: What does record date and ex-date mean?Record date:The record date is when the company checks its records to identify the eligible shareholders for a corporate action. Shareholders holding the shares in their demat accounts on the record date are eligible for corporate actions such as entitlement of rights shares, bonus shares, stock splits, dividends, etc.Ex-Date:The date on which a stock starts trading without the benefit of corporate action, i.e., ex-benefit, is known as the ex-date. The ex-date and the record date for all the corporate actions are on the same day since all the instruments are moved to the T+1 settlement cycle.  A stock will trade with the benefits of the corporate action or cum-benefit (i.e., cum-rights, cum-dividend, etc.) until the ex-date or the record date.Example ScenarioIf the record date or ex-date for a corporate action is Wednesday, shares must be purchased on or before Tuesday to qualify for corporate action benefits. The stock will trade with corporate action benefits until Tuesday, after which it will trade ex-corporate action starting Wednesday. Shares purchased on Wednesday will not be eligible for corporate action benefits.For instance, ifStock Aannounces a dividend of ₹10 with a record date on Wednesday and trades at ₹500 on Tuesday, Wednesday will also be the ex-dividend date, causing the stock price to decrease by the dividend amount, which is ₹10.

Title: How does Zerodha square off positions?
Content: How does Zerodha square off positions?The process of squaring off positions is subject to Zerodha’s discretion and may differ from the scenarios mentioned below.Zerodha squares off positions when intraday positions are not squared off by the client, required margins are not maintained, the collateral value from pledged stocks decreases due to increased haircuts, value of the pledged stocks is falling, etc. To learn more, seeWhy does Zerodha square off positions?When multiple positions are held, and some of them need to be squared off because of a margin shortfall, Zerodha decides which positions to close based on the following factors:Multiple futures positionsIf a client holds multiple futures positions with different expiries and one of them needs to be squared off due to a margin shortfall, Zerodha will generally close the contract closest to expiry, i.e., the near-month contract, instead of the next month or far-month contract to the extent of the shortfall amount. The preference for near-month contracts is mainly due to higher liquidity (more buyers and sellers), which helps reduce impact costs. To learn more about impact costs, seeWhat are Iceberg orders, and how to use them?Far-month contracts have lower liquidity, leading to a wider bid-ask spread (the difference between the maximum price a buyer will pay and the minimum price a seller will accept for an instrument). This wider bid-ask spread can increase trading costs, potentially leading to larger losses for the client if Zerodha chooses to square off these far-month expiry positions.If a client holds multiple futures positions of different instruments with the same expiry, Zerodha’s preference will be to close the position with the lowest bid-ask spread.Example scenarioA client holds November’s Futures positions of ABBOTINDIA and AMBUJACEMENT, and one of the positions is supposed to be squared off because of a margin shortfall. Zerodha gives preference to closing the position in the contract that has a smaller bid-ask spread compared to other held positions.The bid-ask spread of the ABBOTINDIA NOV Futures contract is almost 80 points, whereas the bid-ask spread of the AMBUJACEM NOV Futures contract is only 0.20. Hence, Zerodha will consider squaring off the AMBUJACEM position.Since the position is squared off to the extent of the margin shortfall amount,Zerodha can decide to square off next month or far month contracts instead of current month’s contract if the required margin for the next or far month expiry is closer to or equivalent to the margin shortfall amount. Zerodha squares off the position based on the extent of the margin shortfall amount.Example ScenarioThere is a margin shortfall of  ₹1 lakh in a client’s account, and they hold ADANIENT’s current and next month’s futures contracts.ADANIENT’s November futures contract, i.e., the current month contract, requires a margin of approximately ₹4 lakh.ACC’s December futures contract, i.e., the next month's expiry, requires a margin of around ₹1.0 lakh.Since positions are squared off based on the extent of the margin shortfall amount, Zerodha may square off the next month's contract, i.e., December’s futures contract, to cover the margin shortfall instead of closing the November contract.If the client holds a position for the current month in an instrument that is under a ban period, Zerodha prefers to close positions in instruments not under the ban, which could be for the next or far-month expiry.The reason for not closing a contract in the ban period is due to the higher margin requirements usually associated with them. Additionally, closing the position for a contract under the ban period would prevent the client from re-initiating the position until the contract is no longer under the ban period. To learn more about ban period, seeWhy do F&O contracts enter the ban period?Multiple positions with different margin requirementsIf a client holds multiple positions with different margin requirements, Zerodha prefers to close positions with higher margin requirements.Example ScenarioA client has a margin shortfall of ₹6 lakh with the following positions:5 lots of ADANIENT with a margin requirement of ₹4,50,000 per lot.5 lots of HINDPETRO with a margin requirement of ₹3,00,000 per lot.10 lots of SBILIFE with a margin requirement of ₹1,50,000 per lot.10 lots of HDFCBANK with a margin requirement of ₹1,50,000 per lot.In this case, Zerodha will reduce 1 lot of ADANIENT and 1 lot of either SBILIFE or HDFCBANK to cover the margin shortfall because Zerodha prioritises closing the positions with the highest required margin and then closing the position closest to the shortfall amount.Stock and Index F&O positionsIf a client holds stock and index F&O positions, Zerodha will prefer squaring off index F&O positions to cover the shortfall. This is because index F&O contracts are more liquid compared to stock F&O contracts. However, Zerodha may decide to square off stock positions instead of index positions in the following cases:If the index position is illiquid, such as deep ITM option contracts or far-month F&O contracts.If a client is holding stock positions more than index positions.Example ScenarioThe client has a shortfall of ₹2.7 lakh in their Zerodha account.They have open positions in BankNifty options and PFC (Power Finance Corporation) futures.Among these positions, the client has 3 lots of BankNifty, each requiring a margin of ₹90,000, and 1 lot of PFC, requiring a margin of ₹2.7 lakh.To cover the shortfall, Zerodha will prioritise closing the BankNifty positions first (₹90,000 per lot x 3 lots = ₹2.7 lakh), rather than the single lot of PFC with the same margin requirement, as index F&O positions are prioritised during the squaring off process.Hedged positionsZerodha generally squares off positions for clients holding hedged positions in a manner that the hedge is not broken, i.e., the positions aren’t naked, or to minimise the client’s potential losses.Example ScenarioA client has a shortfall in their Zerodha account, and they have not added funds or squared off their positions to cover the shortfall. Zerodha decides to square off their positions to the extent of the margin shortfall.A client has open positions, specifically in long Futures and long Put option (PE) contracts.Given the nature of the client's positions, Zerodha takes into account the hedged setup. Squaring off only one type of option (either long Futures or long PE option) could break the hedge, potentially exposing the client to greater risk.Since futures positions are settled on an MTM basis and options positions are settled when squared off or expired. If the market moves against the Futures positions, the MTM loss will be settled on the same day leading to a margin shortfall. To learn more about MTM, seeWhat is Mark to Market (MTM)?Therefore, Zerodha will square off the equivalent of both the Futures and options positions. This action maintains the balance of the hedge, reducing the client's exposure to further market volatility.The exact quantities to be squared off from each position would be determined based on the weightage of the options. This could depend on factors such as the liquidity of the positions, the margin requirements, current market prices, etc.This way, Zerodha ensures that the client's shortfall is covered without breaking the hedge.Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is a fractional share?
Content: What is a fractional share?A fractional share is a portion of a stock that is less than one full share and is typically a result of corporate actions such as stock splits or bonus shares. Fractional shares cannot be traded in the market and cannot be bought or sold.Example scenarioIf an individual holds 9 shares of ABC Ltd and the company declares a 3-for-2 stock split, they will be eligible to receive 4.5 extra shares, which would increase their total number of shares to 13.5. However, it's common for companies to round up to the nearest whole number of shares in such scenarios so that they might end up with 14 shares instead.Fractional shares also arise when a company merges with another firm and the share swap ratio is unequal to the number of shares held by shareholders. In such cases, shareholders may receive fractional shares of the new company.Assuming an individual holds 29 shares of ABC Ltd, which has recently merged with another company named XYZ Ltd. Suppose XYZ Ltd offers one stock for every five stocks of ABC Ltd held (1:5). In this case, the individual would only receive 5 shares (5*5 = 25) of the new company XYZ, leaving them with 4 shares of the old company ABC (29-25). As a result, the individual would be entitled to a fractional share of 0.8 (4 shares / 5 = 0.8) of XYZ.Can fractional shares be sold?It is not possible to sell fractional shares in the market. Instead, the company appoints a trustee to buy back the fractional shares from investors, and the proceeds are credited to the primary bank account.Related articlesWhat is consolidation of shares?Rights Issues and Rights Entitlements (RE) - FAQsWhy did CDSL or NSDL deposit money to my bank account?How to redeem fractional units of Liquidbees?How to short sell shares in equity and futures?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why were the shares not eligible for corporate action benefits even though they were purchased before the ex-date?
Content: Why were the shares not eligible for corporate action benefits even though they were purchased before the ex-date?Investors need to hold the shares in their demat accounts on or before the ex-date or record date to be eligible for corporate action benefits. To learn more, seeWhat does record date and ex-date mean?Shares that have not been credited to the demat account by the record date or ex-date will not qualify for corporate action benefits. However, shares bought on or prior to the day before the ex-date/record date will always be credited, except in the following circumstances:Settlement holiday:In case of a settlement holiday on the ex-date/record date, the shares will be credited to the demat account on the next working settlement day. For instance, if the shares are bought on Monday, but Tuesday (the record date) is a settlement holiday, the shares will only be delivered by Wednesday, which means they won't be eligible for any corporate action benefits. Therefore, shares must be purchased at least one trading day before Monday to ensure that they are available in the demat account on the ex-date/record date.Short delivery:When the seller fails to deliver the shares, it is classified as short. In such situations, the exchange generally carries out an auction and delivers the shares to the demat account by T+2 days. Therefore, if shares are purchased on Monday but credited to the demat account on Wednesday or later due to short delivery, they will not be eligible for corporate action benefits since they were not present in the demat account on the ex-date/record date.Did you know?In case shares are purchased on the ex-date/record date, the stock price would have already decreased to account for the corporate action. This indicates that in nearly all instances, there would be no notional for failing to participate in the corporate action.Related articlesWhy are the bonus shares not visible in the holdings even though the company has issued it?What is Nudge?Why are GTTs disabled, cancelled, expired, or rejected?What is the impact of a bonus issue on equity holdings and F&O positions?What does record date and ex-date mean?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is a stock split?
Content: What is a stock split?A stock split is a corporate action where a company increases the number of shares by reducing the face value of the stock. Companies generally split shares to increase liquidity since the price of the stock reduces after the split. A split increases the number of shares by decreasing the face value, but the total value of the investment remains the same. The split shares will be credited in 2 days.Example scenarioWhen a stock with a face value of ₹10 undergoes a 2:1 stock split, its face value reduces from ₹10 to ₹5. This results in doubling the number of shares owned, but the total investment value remains constant at ₹10. Although the value per share decreases after the split, the total investment value remains the same.Here are some more scenarios:Split RatioOld FVNo. of shares owned before splitShare price before splitInvestment value before splitNew FV after the splitNo. of shares you own after the splitShare price after the splitInvestment value after the split2:11010090090,000520045090,0005:11010090090,000250018090,000To learn more about stock splits and other corporate actions, visitzerodha.com/varsity/chapter/five-corporate-actions-and-its-impact-on-stock-prices.All the current and upcoming corporate actions can be tracked on this list(DOC).Related articlesWhy are GTTs disabled, cancelled, expired, or rejected?What is Nudge?Why are split shares not visible in the holdings?Why is the buy average for some shares shown as N/A?What is consolidation of shares?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is consolidation of shares?
Content: What is consolidation of shares?Consolidation of shares is a corporate action where a company reduces the number of outstanding shares by combining the shares and increasing the face value. Consolidation of shares is also known asreverse stock split.The company notifies the shareholders through email before the stock consolidation.Example scenarioMr A holds 10,000 shares at ₹10 each. In the case of a share consolidation in the ratio of 1:5, the 5 shares will be reduced to 1 share. The 10,000 shares will be reduced to 2000 shares. The number of shares reduces, but the overall value of the shares remains the same.Value of holdings before the consolidation of shares: 10,000 × 10 = ₹1,00,000Value of holdings after the consolidation of shares: 2000 × 50 = ₹1,00,000There are scenarios where the shareholder could be left with a unit of stock that is less than one full share due to the reverse stock split or consolidation of shares. These shares are called fractional shares. Since fractional shares don’t trade in markets, the company appoints a trustee to buy them. The trustee then buys back those fractional shares from the investors, and the proceeds are credited to the primary bank account.

This can be done through a tender offer or by purchasing shares on the open market. To learn more about Buyback, seeWhat is a Buyback?Previously, only a tender offer ensured that the company would be the sole buyer of shares in a buyback. Selling shares in the open market during the buyback period carried uncertainty regarding the company's repurchase.However, in order to facilitate open market offers, exchanges have introduced a series called BO on NSE(PDF).These series allow clients to participate directly in open buybacks through their broker's platform.

Title: Why was the OFS allotment not received even though the request was placed before the cut-off?
Content: Why was the OFS allotment not received even though the request was placed before the cut-off?The Offer For Sale(OFS) allotment is decided by the exchanges and not the broker. The cut-off price is established based on bids made by the non-retail category, and the allotment price can be higher depending on the demand for the OFS shares.During the first day of the OFS, bids from the non-retail category (those above ₹2 lakhs or corporate entities) are accepted, and the cut-off price for allocation is determined based on these bids. If the OFS allotment is received, the funds are debited, and the shares are delivered to the demat account on the next trading day i.e. T+1 day.Example ScenarioAssuming a floor price of ₹100 for an OFS issue, and the cut-off price is established at ₹110 based on general bids, only retail bids of ₹110 or higher are considered on the second day. If 1000 shares are reserved for retail allotment and the retail demand is for 1500 shares, the following allotment scenarios are possible:Mr A gets 400 shares at ₹110Mr B gets 500 shares at ₹111Mr C gets 600 shares at ₹112Depending on the basis of allotment opted for by the company, the following allotment scenarios are possible:Price priority (multiple prices) basis:There are two ways retail investors may be allocated shares under the price-priority method:At the cut-off price, irrespective of the investor's bid price, Mr B and Mr C get 600 shares and 400 shares each at ₹110. Mr A gets nothing.At the investor's bid price, Mr C gets 600 shares at ₹112. Mr B gets 400 shares at ₹111. Mr A gets nothing.Proportionate basis at a single clearing price:Retail investors are allocated shares on a proportionate basis at the cut-off price. Mr C, Mr B and Mr A get shares at Rs. 110 in the ratio of 6:5:4. In other words, Mr C gets 400 shares, Mr B gets 333 shares, and Mr A gets 267 shares at ₹110.In both allocation methods, bids below the cut-off price are not considered, and the allotment price is reduced by the discount offered to the retail category (if any).

Title: Why has the average price been reduced after receiving bonus shares in Zerodha?
Content: Why has the average price been reduced after receiving bonus shares in Zerodha?The average price, or buy average price, of a stock is reduced after the credit of bonus shares to the account because the bonus shares are credited at no cost, and the holding average is calculated using the First In First Out (FIFO) method. As bonus shares are free, their buy price is considered zero. Thus, when these bonus shares are added to the demat account at a zero cost, the buy average is changed.Example ScenarioBuy average before the bonus issue:DateSymbolTrade TypeQuantity (A)Price (B)Value (A*B)01/02/2021XYZBuy12975297502/02/2021XYZBuy12970297003/02/2021XYZBuy129452945Total38890Here, the investor has bought the shares of XYZ Limited on 3 different days at 3 different prices. Buy average for these stocks is calculated as:Total Value / Total quantity=8890/3=2963.33The buy average price of the share is ₹2963.33/-.Buy average after the bonus issue:Now, assume on 10th Feb 2021 XYZ the company issues a bonus, in the ratio of 3:1, i.e. 3 shares for every 1 share held. The investor will be eligible to receive 9 bonus shares on 10th Feb since the investor already has 3 shares in the demat account. Therefore, the buy average changes to:DateSymbolTrade TypeQuantity (A)Price (B)Value (A*B)01/02/2021XYZBuy12975297502/02/2021XYZBuy12970297003/02/2021XYZBuy12945294510/02/2021XYZBonus900Total128890Hence, the new buy average post bonus issue is calculated as:= 8890/12= 740.833Sell transactionNow, assume on 1st April 2021, if 2 shares are sold, the FIFO rule comes into play. According to FIFO, the two shares that were purchased first will be considered sold. Consequently, the shares bought on 1st and 2nd February at 2975 and 2970 will be considered sold.The remaining shares will be considered for the new buy average. The calculation is as follows:DateSymbolTrade TypeQuantity (A)Price (B)Value (A*B)03/02/2021XYZBuy12945294510/02/2021XYZBonus900Total102945Buy average = Total buy/ Total Quantity=2945/10=294.50FIFO impacts and further reduces the investor's buy average. Suppose the investor sells another share at a later date. In that case, the share bought on 3rd February 2021 will be removed based on the FIFO rule. This leaves behind only the 9 shares received via bonus, resulting in a buy average for these shares of:DateSymbolTrade TypeQuantity (A)Price (B)Value (A*B)10/02/2021XYZBonus900Total90= 0/9=0Hence, the buy average will go down to 0.From the above examples, it can be understood how the buy average can decrease or even become zero after the issuance of bonus shares when shares are sold. On occasions, bonus shares may not be visible in the holdings, even when the price of the stock has decreased.

Title: What is a Bonus issue?
Content: What is a Bonus issue?A bonus issue is the distribution of free shares by the company to the existing shareholders. A company may decide to distribute additional shares as an alternative to dividend payout. In a bonus issue, the number of shares increases, but the value of the investment remains the same.Example scenarioMr A holds 100 shares of a company at ₹10 each. If that company announces a 2:1 bonus, that is, for every one share, the shareholder will receive two shares for free, Mr A will receive 200 shares for the 100 shares held in the demat account, and Mr A's total holdings will be 300 shares. However, the investment value will remain the same.Value of investment before Bonus issue: 100 × ₹10 = ₹1000Value of investment after Bonus issue: 300 × ₹3.33(300/1000) = ₹1000Shares must be purchased before the ex-date to be eligible for a bonus.

Title: Why haven't the bonus shares appeared in the holdings despite the decrease in stock price?
Content: Why haven't the bonus shares appeared in the holdings despite the decrease in stock price?Bonus shares are shares that are given to existing shareholders free of charge, based on the number of shares they currently hold. The allotment of bonus shares is usually done in a fixed ratio, such as 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and so on. To be eligible for bonus shares, shareholders must hold shares on the ex-date/record date, which is determined by the T+1 settlement cycle. For instance, if the ex-date/record date for the bonus is 10th April, shareholders must buy the stock on or before 9th April.The same concept applies to dividends. When bonus shares are issued, the share price decreases based on the ratio of the issue, but the total investment value of the held stocks remains the same. The remaining value is then given to the shareholders in the form of bonus shares. The balance amount is credited to the shareholder's registered bank account if the eligible bonus shares are not in whole numbers.It typically takes around 15 days from the record date for bonus shares to be credited to the shareholder's demat account, but this can vary depending on the Registrar and Share Transfer Agents (RTA). Shareholders receive a notification from CDSL when the bonus shares are credited to their demat account. The bonus shares are first credited under a temporary ISIN and are not immediately admitted to trading. It usually takes around 4-5 days for the shares to move from the temporary ISIN to the permanent ISIN after receiving approval for trading. The bonus shares will only appear on Kite after being approved for trading.Before bonus shares are credited to the shareholder's demat account, their holdings in Kite/Console may display an artificial drop in P&L. Once the bonus shares are credited to the demat account, the P&L will be restored to its correct value. Zerodha displays the bonus quantity only after it has been credited. Bonus and stock splits have similar impacts, but there is a difference in the face value of the shares. In stock splits, the face value of the shares is reduced.All the current and upcoming corporate actions can be tracked on this list(DOC).Related articlesWhat is a Bonus issue?Why has the average price been reduced after receiving bonus shares in Zerodha?What is the impact of a bonus issue on equity holdings and F&O positions?Why are GTTs disabled, cancelled, expired, or rejected?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is the impact of a bonus issue on equity holdings and F&O positions?
Content: What is the impact of a bonus issue on equity holdings and F&O positions?A bonus issue is the distribution of free shares by the company to eligible shareholders. To learn more, seeWhat is a Bonus issue?Impact on holdingsThe share price falls in the ratio of the bonus allotment. However, this does not affect the overall value of holdings. Zerodha displays the bonus quantity only after they are credited.Example scenarioMr A holds 10 shares of Reliance at ₹1000 each, and the company has announced a bonus issue in the ratio of 2:1. So Mr A will receive 2 bonus shares of Reliance for every share held on the ex-date/record date.Mr A’s holdings will now have 30 shares of Reliance after the bonus issue (10 originally bought + 20 bonus shares).In the above example, the share price will drop to ₹333.33 [1000/(2+1)], but this won’t change the value of Mr A’s holdings.Value of holdings before bonus: 10 × 1000 = ₹10,000Value of holdings after bonus: 30 × 333.33 = ₹10,000If a company announces a 1:2 bonus and an investor holds just 1 share, they will get 0.5 shares as a bonus. The 0.5 shares are known as partial bonus shares that are settled in cash, and the funds will be credited to the investor's primary bank account.Impact on P&LP&L will show an artificial drop until the bonus shares are credited to the demat account. Once the shares are credited, the P&L will be updated. It takes up to 15 days for the bonus shares to be credited. An SMS from CDSL will be sent when the shares are credited.Impact on F&O positionsOption strike prices are divided by the factor of the bonus issue ratio. For a 1:1 issue, the factor is 2. The future and options prices are divided by a factor of 2 to maintain the same contract value as before the bonus issue. The revised lot size is arrived at by multiplying the factor with the current lot size.Bonus ratio: 1:1Strike price: 100Lot size: 500Revised lot size: 1000 (i.e., 500×2)Revised strike price: 50 (i.e., 100/2)If the revised market lot size is not updated, do a hard refresh by pressing CTRL+Shift+R on Kite web, or clear the app cache on Kite app. To learn the steps to clear the app data, seeHow to clear the Kite app data?All the current and upcoming corporate actions can be tracked on this list(DOC).Related articlesWhy has the average price been reduced after receiving bonus shares in Zerodha?Why are GTTs disabled, cancelled, expired, or rejected?How will the P&L for G-sec be represented on Console?Why is the buy average price not updated for stocks received as gifts through Console?Why is the buy average for some shares shown as N/A?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

This feature aims to promote responsible trading, especially in the context of potentially risky index options. To learn more, seeWhy should a stoploss be set using GTT when buying stock or index options?When purchasing index options, the order window will display a prompt to place a GTT stop-loss price. Although it's possible to proceed with the order without configuring a GTT stop-loss, Zerodha strongly recommends using this feature to safeguard investments and manage risk effectively.GTT stop-loss orders can serve as a valuable tool for minimising potential losses and establishing a predefined exit strategy. The GTT stop-loss order remains in effect until clients opt to cancel it, ensuring ongoing protection and peace of mind. If there's uncertainty about setting an appropriate stop-loss percentage, a range of 5 to 10% serves as a solid starting point.

Title: Why should a stoploss be set using GTT when buying stock or index options?
Content: Why should a stoploss be set using GTT when buying stock or index options?Buying options is by the far the riskiest form of trading if you aren’t following proper risk management rules. Your entire invested capital is at risk when you buy an option contract. The option premium can lose most of its value very quickly depending upon itsmoneyness,time value (theta)orany one of the other factorsthat affect option prices.When buying options it is important that you don’t risk more than 2% of your trading capital at any one time. If you are taking positions larger than this, it is important that you define a stoploss and stick to it. Doing this can significantly improve the odds when trading options.Readthis Zconnect postto learn more.You can place a long-standing stoploss order using GTT for your option positions right at the time of buying the options or even from the positions tab on Kite as shown below.GTT stoploss when buying optionsYou can set any stoploss % for your order. In case your option buy price is Rs. 80 and you set a 10% stoploss, then the stoploss will get triggered once the option price touches Rs. 72. Since this is a limit stoploss order, a sell order at Rs. 72 will be placed. The trigger price and limit price are the same when placing the GTT stoploss from the order window. You can edit the limit price from the GTT menu under Orders or if you place a GTT from the positions window.GTT stoploss from positionsIf you exit this position on your own (GTT Stoploss not triggered), make sure to cancel the pending GTT stoploss order as shown below.Note:All GTT stoploss orders by default are limit orders. So in the above example, if the GTT is triggered at 72, a selling Nifty 16000 CE order is placed at a price of 72. If the market moves fast, this may not get executed. A stoploss GTT order if once triggered and is not executed will have to be placed again by you for the next trading day.Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

The required margin will be different based on the sequence of the individual orders, while the final margin will be the same. For F&O strategies, placing buy option orders before future or short/writing option orders is advisable. By doing so, the F&O strategy will be executed with the least margin requirement, as displayed below:The sequence of orders is not significant when placing an equity basket order or when adequate margins are available for placing individual orders.To include open positions that are not part of the basket and check margin requirements, select theInclude existing positionsoption. However, this option may display a required margin of 0 even when the margin is required to place the order. This is because an order in the basket might reduce the overall margin while still requiring a margin for placement. If this is confusing, it is better to disable the option.ExecutionAfter clicking the execute option on Basket, orders are placed in the same sequence as in the basket. It is important to confirm the status of all individual orders within the basket or on the Kite order book if they were placed, executed, or rejected once the basket order is executed.Duplicate option to get over the order freeze or quantity limitMaximum limits are set per order when trading stocks and F&O. If orders exceed these limits, they must be placed multiple times. Baskets make this process easy, especially with the duplicate order function.Replacing a rejected orderAssume that some orders included in a basket are rejected for some reason.

Title: Why are the orders in the baskets executed partially?
Content: Why are the orders in the baskets executed partially?Basket orders offer a convenient way to execute multiple individual orders simultaneously. Each order within the basket order undergoes the same checks as an individual order. If the conditions specified by the client are met, the orders are executed accordingly. However, if there are insufficient funds to fulfil the entire basket order, the execution will be partial, and only the orders that can be processed with the available funds will be executed.Example ScenarioSuppose the client has ₹2000/- in their trading account. They place one buy order amounting to ₹1500/- and another buy order amounting to ₹ 3000/- within a basket order.In this scenario, the client's buy order for ₹ 1500/- will be executed successfully as there are sufficient funds to cover that amount. However, the buy order for ₹ 3000/- will be rejected due to insufficient funds, resulting in partial execution of the basket order.Did you know?A basket order can be rejected for various reasons, including but not limited to insufficient margin, incorrect use of order type, and the specific instrument not being available or blocked for trading, among other possible factors.Related articlesHow to place basket orders on Kite?How to use the basket order feature on Kite app?What is the required and the final margin in a basket order?How to import files to execute trades on Kite?How to share Kite baskets?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

The final margin is not a separate margin that should be added, but it will be blocked from the required margin after execution. To learn more about basket orders, seeHow to place basket orders on Kite?Example ScenarioSuppose Mr A places a basket of options spread in Nifty options, i.e. BUY NIFTY SEP 15500 CE and SELL NIFTY15700 CE.Mr A needs to maintain a required margin of 1,20,104.55/- to initiate the order. However, when the order is executed, only 29,422.05/- will be blocked.Let's understand how the final margin in an options spread basket order is calculated:When Mr A short/writes an option as an option seller, he receives the premium, which is then debited to ascertain the final margin.Considering the previous example:The required margin to place a short order without the spread is 2,05,943.80/-Since a spread basket order has been created, the margin requirement for the short order reduces to 19,354/-.The premium received here is 90,682/-, as seen in the buy order window.Hence, the final margin is calculated as 29,422.05/-, which is the required margin minus the premium (1,20,104.55 - 90,682.50).Related articlesHow to place basket orders on Kite?How to use the basket order feature on Kite app?Why is the entire margin required to enter into a hedged position?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is a nudge displayed saying that the order price is x% above or below the Last Traded Price (LTP)?
Content: Why is a nudge displayed saying that the order price is x% above or below the Last Traded Price (LTP)?This nudge is displayed when a limit order is placed above the LTP for buy orders and below the LTP for sell orders. In these cases, the limit order is executed as a market order and is also called market protection order. This is because a limit order allows the clients to buy or sell an instrument at a specific price or a better price.Example ScenarioThe LTP of Axis Bank is ₹965.55. The best bid and offer are at ₹965.50 and ₹966.00, respectively.Buy limit orderBuy limit orders are executed at the limit price or lower than the limit price. If the limit price for a buy order is higher than the LTP, the order will be executed as a market order since the LTP is lower than the limit price.A buy limit order is placed at ₹970 when the LTP of Axis bank is ₹965.55.The order gets executed at the market price since there is an offer to sell at ₹966, i.e., lower than the limit price of ₹970.The client receives the stock for  ₹966 instead of ₹970, i.e., ₹4 less than what the client was willing to pay.If the client still wants to buy the stock at ₹970, Stoploss (SL) or Good Till Triggered (GTT) orders can be used.

Title: Why was the withdrawal request rejected?
Content: Why was the withdrawal request rejected?Withdrawal requests can be rejected due to the following reasons:Funds from trades are yet to be settled. The funds from equity and F&O trades are not settled instantly. Exchanges require T+1 day to settle funds from selling equities, and F&O trades to the Zerodha account before they can be withdrawn. In the case of intraday and F&O, it is the time taken for the realised profits, M2M, or sell value of options to be credited to the Zerodha account. SeeWhat does settlement cycle mean?Funds added during the day are available for trading immediately, but cannot be withdrawn on the same day. Since Zerodha has to reconcile the balances at the end of the day to avoid issues with crediting funds, these funds can be withdrawn after one day.¹Funds added through a payment gateway can take up to T+1 days to be credited to Zerodha. In case the funds are not credited immediately, Zerodha's capital is blocked to allow clients to trade on T day, and hence same day withdrawals are not possible.²Did you know?If a withdrawal request for an amount greater than the withdrawal balance is placed, the available withdrawable balance will be credited to the bank account. SeeWhat is withdrawable balance on Console?Example ScenarioThe withdrawable balance is ₹9000.A withdrawal request for ₹12,000 is placed.₹9000 will be credited to the bank account.Notes¹Withdrawal requests are processed after the trading session, since the obligations for all the trades during the day have to be considered. Since there can be issues with crediting of funds, withdrawal requests are processed after reconciling the funds with the respective banks. Due to the volume of the transactions, banks share the transaction details by the early morning of the next day, i.e., T+1 day. After receiving the transactions details, Zerodha reconciles them and fund withdrawals are processed.There have also been cases where Zerodha has received the wrong confirmation of fund credits from banks, and transactions have been reversed. In order to avoid such issues, fund withdrawal requests are processed on T+1 day.²When funds are transferred through payment gateways, clients get the credit on the same day. But the funds are settled by the payment gateways only on T+1 or T+2 days to Zerodha’s account. Until then, Zerodha funds the margins for the trades from its own capital. Since Zerodha receives credit of funds transferred through payments gateways on T+1 or T+2 days, processing withdrawal requests of funds added on the same day would mean funding them from Zerodha’s own capital.

Title: How is withdrawable balance calculated after pledging?
Content: How is withdrawable balance calculated after pledging?You can pledge the securities in the demat account to trade F&O. When you do so, the funds that you can withdraw from your account will be calculated after making the adjustments across the cash in your account and the collateral margin that is blocked for your F&O positions.At least 50% of the margins blocked for F&O positions have to come in the form of cash or cash equivalent collateral. The other 50% of the margin requirement can come in the form of other non-cash equivalent collateral margins.Example scenarioAssume you initiate an F&O position that requires a margin of ₹1,00,000. Before initiating the F&O position, you have:Cash: ₹70,000Collateral Margin: ₹ 80,000 from securities pledged and after applying the required haircutCash Equivalent: ₹20,000 from pledged liquidbees.Here is how ₹ 1,00,000/- for the F&O margin will be accounted for:ComponentAvailable for use (INR)Utilized (INR)Balance (INR)Collateral Margin80,00050,00030,000Cash Equivalent20,00020,0000.00Cash70,00030,00040,000Total Margin collected1,00,000This leaves you with a withdrawable balance of ₹40,000.The formula used to calculate the withdrawable balance is -Withdrawable balance = (Available cash balance - Proceeds from stocks sold yesterday & today - F&O profits today - Funds added today)Available cash balance = Closing balance as per the Funds Statement - Unsettled credits - Funds added today + Collateral utilisedUnsettled credits = Today’s and yesterday’s credits in the equity segment + Today’s credits in the derivative segmentCollateral utilised = Total collateral used towards margin requirement from the cash and non-cash equivalentsIf you do not have enough collateral margins to cover 50% of the margin blocked, the difference is also charged from the available cash balance, which in turn will reduce your withdrawable balance further.Did you know?Collateral margin received from pledging stocks or liquid mutual funds to trade F&O will not be considered part of the withdrawable balance.Funds added during the day are available for trading immediately. However, since we need to perform a balance reconciliation at the end of the day, you can withdraw these funds only after one day.Securities forming part of the cash and non-cash components can be tracked on the approved list of securities at Zerodhaby visitingzerodha.com/approved-securities.Related articlesWhen shares are pledged and collateral margin is received, a debit balance is reflected in the funds statement.

Title: Why was the withdrawal request rejected?
Content: Why was the withdrawal request rejected?Withdrawal requests can be rejected due to the following reasons:Funds from trades are yet to be settled. The funds from equity and F&O trades are not settled instantly. Exchanges require T+1 day to settle funds from selling equities, and F&O trades to the Zerodha account before they can be withdrawn. In the case of intraday and F&O, it is the time taken for the realised profits, M2M, or sell value of options to be credited to the Zerodha account. SeeWhat does settlement cycle mean?Funds added during the day are available for trading immediately, but cannot be withdrawn on the same day. Since Zerodha has to reconcile the balances at the end of the day to avoid issues with crediting funds, these funds can be withdrawn after one day.¹Funds added through a payment gateway can take up to T+1 days to be credited to Zerodha. In case the funds are not credited immediately, Zerodha's capital is blocked to allow clients to trade on T day, and hence same day withdrawals are not possible.²Did you know?If a withdrawal request for an amount greater than the withdrawal balance is placed, the available withdrawable balance will be credited to the bank account. SeeWhat is withdrawable balance on Console?Example ScenarioThe withdrawable balance is ₹9000.A withdrawal request for ₹12,000 is placed.₹9000 will be credited to the bank account.Notes¹Withdrawal requests are processed after the trading session, since the obligations for all the trades during the day have to be considered. Since there can be issues with crediting of funds, withdrawal requests are processed after reconciling the funds with the respective banks. Due to the volume of the transactions, banks share the transaction details by the early morning of the next day, i.e., T+1 day. After receiving the transactions details, Zerodha reconciles them and fund withdrawals are processed.There have also been cases where Zerodha has received the wrong confirmation of fund credits from banks, and transactions have been reversed. In order to avoid such issues, fund withdrawal requests are processed on T+1 day.²When funds are transferred through payment gateways, clients get the credit on the same day. But the funds are settled by the payment gateways only on T+1 or T+2 days to Zerodha’s account. Until then, Zerodha funds the margins for the trades from its own capital. Since Zerodha receives credit of funds transferred through payments gateways on T+1 or T+2 days, processing withdrawal requests of funds added on the same day would mean funding them from Zerodha’s own capital.

Title: How is withdrawable balance calculated after pledging?
Content: How is withdrawable balance calculated after pledging?You can pledge the securities in the demat account to trade F&O. When you do so, the funds that you can withdraw from your account will be calculated after making the adjustments across the cash in your account and the collateral margin that is blocked for your F&O positions.At least 50% of the margins blocked for F&O positions have to come in the form of cash or cash equivalent collateral. The other 50% of the margin requirement can come in the form of other non-cash equivalent collateral margins.Example scenarioAssume you initiate an F&O position that requires a margin of ₹1,00,000. Before initiating the F&O position, you have:Cash: ₹70,000Collateral Margin: ₹ 80,000 from securities pledged and after applying the required haircutCash Equivalent: ₹20,000 from pledged liquidbees.Here is how ₹ 1,00,000/- for the F&O margin will be accounted for:ComponentAvailable for use (INR)Utilized (INR)Balance (INR)Collateral Margin80,00050,00030,000Cash Equivalent20,00020,0000.00Cash70,00030,00040,000Total Margin collected1,00,000This leaves you with a withdrawable balance of ₹40,000.The formula used to calculate the withdrawable balance is -Withdrawable balance = (Available cash balance - Proceeds from stocks sold yesterday & today - F&O profits today - Funds added today)Available cash balance = Closing balance as per the Funds Statement - Unsettled credits - Funds added today + Collateral utilisedUnsettled credits = Today’s and yesterday’s credits in the equity segment + Today’s credits in the derivative segmentCollateral utilised = Total collateral used towards margin requirement from the cash and non-cash equivalentsIf you do not have enough collateral margins to cover 50% of the margin blocked, the difference is also charged from the available cash balance, which in turn will reduce your withdrawable balance further.Did you know?Collateral margin received from pledging stocks or liquid mutual funds to trade F&O will not be considered part of the withdrawable balance.Funds added during the day are available for trading immediately. However, since we need to perform a balance reconciliation at the end of the day, you can withdraw these funds only after one day.Securities forming part of the cash and non-cash components can be tracked on the approved list of securities at Zerodhaby visitingzerodha.com/approved-securities.Related articlesWhen shares are pledged and collateral margin is received, a debit balance is reflected in the funds statement.

Content: What does cut-off price mean?The offer price at which shares are issued to investors in an IPO is known as the cut-off price, which can be any price within the specified price band. For this particular IPO displayed in the below image, the issue price range is 72-76. If an investor applies for the IPO at the cut-off price, they cannot enter a separate price.An IPO book-building issue typically begins with a specified price range, within which an investor can place bids for their desired quantity in multiples of the lot size. If an investor chooses the cut-off option while applying for the issue, it indicates their willingness to subscribe to shares at any price discovered within the price band through the book-building process. This increases the possibility of an allotment, allowing the investor to participate in the entire price-discovery process.If an investor selects the cut-off option, they become eligible for allotment at any issue price discovered through the book-building process. However, the cut-off price cannot be selected for HNI applications, i.e., bids above ₹2,00,000. Also, exchanges do not allow the cut-off option for SME IPOs.Related articlesHow to complete payments for the purchase orders on Coin?How to apply for an Initial Public Offering (IPO)?How to pre-apply for an IPO?Why is the average cost for shares allotted in an IPO not displayed?Why are holdings not displayed in the exchange where they were bought?Still need help?Create a ticket

For this particular IPO displayed in the below image, the issue price range is 72-76. If an investor applies for the IPO at the cut-off price, they cannot enter a separate price.An IPO book-building issue typically begins with a specified price range, within which an investor can place bids for their desired quantity in multiples of the lot size. If an investor chooses the cut-off option while applying for the issue, it indicates their willingness to subscribe to shares at any price discovered within the price band through the book-building process. This increases the possibility of an allotment, allowing the investor to participate in the entire price-discovery process.If an investor selects the cut-off option, they become eligible for allotment at any issue price discovered through the book-building process. However, the cut-off price cannot be selected for HNI applications, i.e., bids above ₹2,00,000. Also, exchanges do not allow the cut-off option for SME IPOs.Related articlesHow to complete payments for the purchase orders on Coin?How to apply for an Initial Public Offering (IPO)?How to pre-apply for an IPO?Why is the average cost for shares allotted in an IPO not displayed?Why are holdings not displayed in the exchange where they were bought?Still need help?Create a ticket

Title: What is XIRR and how to check it in Zerodha?
Content: What is XIRR and how to check it in Zerodha?Extended Internal Rate of Return (XIRR), is used to calculate the annualised return on investments, taking into account the timing and amounts of multiple cash flows.When calculating returns on investments over multiple years with various transactions, relying only on absolute returns, which ignore the investment time period, may not provide an accurate result.For more accuracy, especially when dealing with multiple investments at different times, such as Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), XIRR can be used. XIRR is an aggregation of multiple Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGRs), with a focus on investments like SIPs. It is particularly valuable for calculating the performance of investments with multiple transaction points and durations beyond one year. To learn more about CAGR, seeWhat does CAGR mean?Several platforms calculate XIRR on the existing holdings breakdown, often neglecting past trades in the same stock. This approach provides an incomplete result, as XIRR is intended for evaluation across a longer timeframe, including all cash flows regardless of their timing. The Console XIRR feature for equity holdings gives a comprehensive XIRR for any stock, including all the trades from FY 2017. It provides a more comprehensive view, considering all cash flows after adjusting all the corporate actions like bonus, split, demerger, and buyback.Investments less than a yearFor investments with a combined breakdown of holdings and P&L less than 365 days, the following message is displayed if a client loads XIRR:XIRR is less suited for short-term investments. Consider absolute returns instead.This is because XIRR is more suited for longer-term assessments.XIRR might display unusual numbers for traders who frequently buy and sell stocks within a short time frame. Despite the mathematical accuracy, it fails to represent the true profit and loss (P&L) accurately.The application of XIRR extends to mutual funds, employing a similar approach that considers all corporate actions related to mutual funds for a precise depiction of annualised gains.

Title: How is the buy average affected when shares from holdings are sold and bought back on the same day?
Content: How is the buy average affected when shares from holdings are sold and bought back on the same day?The buy average calculation is unaffected by intraday trades of shares that are part of the holdings since these trades are considered as separate transactions. This is because the shares do not physically move in or out of the demat account.Example Scenario50 shares of Reliance were purchased at ₹500 in 2021 and are currently held in the demat account.The current trading price of Reliance is approximately ₹2500.If these shares are sold at ₹2500 and bought back on the same day for ₹2400, the intraday trade will not impact the buy average.The buy average will still remain at ₹500.The buy average is calculated by considering the tax implications of trades. According to IT Rules, any transaction that does not result in delivery in or out of demat is classified as intraday and is considered speculative, and such transactions must be categorized separately. It is important to keep intraday trades separate from delivery transactions, which are evaluated for capital gains.However, this is not applicable for T2T stocks since the buy average will be the latest buy price.

T-Bills with maturities of 91 days will soon be available.Many users may have limited cash margins despite having stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds in their holdings, leading to missed trading opportunities. To avoid this, they can pledge their shares, mutual funds, and government securities such as T-bills and SGBs as collateral margins, after a % deduction called a haircut. These margins can be used for equity intraday trading, futures & options writing (equity and currency F&O), subject to being adjusted for price variations at the end of each trading day. Commodity futures and options cannot be traded using collateral margins. To learn more about pledging, seeHow to pledge shares to get collateral margin?However, collateral margins cannot be used until negative balances are cleared. The collateral amount is calculated from the previous closing price of the securities after a haircut, and it is added to the total margin available on Kite. The collateral margin received is shown separately in theFundstab on Kite, under the collateral heading. To learn more, seeWhat does Collateral(Equity) in the ‘funds’ mean?The exchanges require that 50% of the margin for F&O positions must be in cash or cash equivalent collateral, while the remaining 50% can be in non-cash collateral margin. In case there is a shortfall in the cash margin requirement for overnight positions, and it is funded by non-cash collateral, a delayed payment charge of 0.035% per day or 12.775% p.a is applicable on the shortfall in the cash margin requirement.

Content: How safe is it to pledge the securities with Zerodha?As per SEBI's(WEB)new pledging mechanism, securities pledged by clients do not physically leave their demat accounts. Instead, a pledge is registered in favour of the broker, who must establish a dedicated demat account designated as theTMCM - Client Securities Margin Pledge Account.(TMCM stands for Trading Member Clearing Member) Subsequently, the broker re-pledges these securities to the clearing corporation to obtain margins.

Additionally, if charges are debited without sufficient balance, it could result in a debit balance. In such instances, interest at 0.05% per day or 18% per annum will be levied on the debit balance.Over-utilisation of non-cash equivalent collateral margin:Exchanges stipulate that forF&O positions, 50% of the margin needs to compulsorily come in cash or cash equivalent collateral, and the remaining 50% can be in terms of non-cash collateral margin. The list of approved instruments that can be pledged for margins and the applicable haircut % can be found in this list(DOC).If sufficient cash margin is not maintained and the shortfall is funded by Zerodha, there will be a delayed payment charge of 0.035% per day or 12.775% per annum on the shortfall in the cash margin requirement.To avoidDelayed Payment Charges,maintain sufficient funds in the Zerodha account.

Title: What does the F&O obligation amount mean?
Content: How to understand the credit/debit on funds statement when trading F&O?The fund statement displays various entries related to F&O obligations, margin debits, margin reversals, etc., for F&O trading. The F&O obligation amount includes the payable or receivable marked-to-market (M2M) amount. For options trades, settlement is based on the net premium receivable or payable. However, the obligation amount is calculated using the M2M price when trading futures contracts. At the end of each day, exchanges mark all open futures positions to the closing settlement price for that day and either credit or debit the corresponding amount in the client's fund statement. To learn more, seeWhat is Mark to Market (MTM)?If a futures trade is not closed during the day, the settlement amount will be determined by the difference between the trade price and the closing settlement price, which will then be settled to the account.In the case of a carried-forward futures position from the previous day that is still being held, the settlement amount will be based on the difference between the previous day's closing price and today's closing price, which will be settled to the account.If a carried-forward futures position from the previous day is squared off, the settlement amount will be determined by the difference between the previous day's closing price and the square-off price, which will then be settled to the account.The obligation amount, which takes into account all charges for the day, can be verified on the contract note.How to download contract notes?The practice of marking-to-market (M2M) is implemented in futures trading due to the unlimited risk involved. Its purpose is to prevent default by ensuring that any losses incurred by one client are collected on the same day and credited to the client making profits. The client experiencing the loss must then ensure that there is sufficient margin in their account to continue holding the position, thus mitigating counterparty risk.In the case of short option positions, M2M is not applied as in futures. However, the margin required to hold short options increases as the options move in the money, causing losses for the holder of the short options. This mechanism ensures that clients experiencing losses must contribute additional funds to minimize default risk.Consequently, Kite displays only the overall profit and loss (P&L) as well as the current day's P&L. The fund statement on Console will reflect multiple credits or debits. Each day the position was held will have a separate entry in the funds statement.

Title: Why is the balance in the funds statement displayed as negative?
Content: Why is the balance in the funds statement displayed as negative?The Zerodha account balance is displayed as negative for the following reasons:Daily marked-to-market (M2M) losses: When holding futures positions, the losses for such positions are settled on a daily basis. The settlement amount is deducted from the available free cash balance, not from SPAN or Exposure margins which may lead to a negative balance in the account if sufficient funds are not maintained.Charges: The account balance will be negative if there aren't sufficient funds in the account and Annual Maintenance charges, DP charges and other charges are deducted from the account.Utilisation of collateral margin: The collateral margin obtained by pledging securities is not included in the funds statement. Therefore, if collateral margin is utilised to take positions, the funds statement may display a negative balance.Example ScenarioA client has an opening balance of ₹1000 and a collateral margin of ₹1000 from stocks.A position is taken that requires ₹2000, and collateral margin is utilised for this position.₹2000 will be blocked from the funds statement at the end of the day, and the balance in the Zerodha account will become -₹1000.The shortfall of ₹1000 is funded through collateral and will not result in any penalty.Thewithdrawable balance on Consolewill also be negative.A brokerage of ₹40 per executed order will be charged instead of ₹20 while placing an F&O order if the Zerodha account has a negative balance.

To learn more, seeWhat is Mark to Market (MTM)?If a futures trade is not closed during the day, the settlement amount will be determined by the difference between the trade price and the closing settlement price, which will then be settled to the account.In the case of a carried-forward futures position from the previous day that is still being held, the settlement amount will be based on the difference between the previous day's closing price and today's closing price, which will be settled to the account.If a carried-forward futures position from the previous day is squared off, the settlement amount will be determined by the difference between the previous day's closing price and the square-off price, which will then be settled to the account.The obligation amount, which takes into account all charges for the day, can be verified on the contract note.How to download contract notes?The practice of marking-to-market (M2M) is implemented in futures trading due to the unlimited risk involved. Its purpose is to prevent default by ensuring that any losses incurred by one client are collected on the same day and credited to the client making profits. The client experiencing the loss must then ensure that there is sufficient margin in their account to continue holding the position, thus mitigating counterparty risk.In the case of short option positions, M2M is not applied as in futures. However, the margin required to hold short options increases as the options move in the money, causing losses for the holder of the short options. This mechanism ensures that clients experiencing losses must contribute additional funds to minimize default risk.Consequently, Kite displays only the overall profit and loss (P&L) as well as the current day's P&L. The fund statement on Console will reflect multiple credits or debits. Each day the position was held will have a separate entry in the funds statement.

The dividends were distributed to investors after deducting the DDT. However, the historical returns displayed on their websites did not account for the DDT.After the budget, the DDT was eliminated, and dividends from liquid ETFs are now subject to taxation based on the investor's individual income tax slab rate.

Title: How to view the long-term and short-term holdings separately?
Content: How to view the long-term and short-term holdings separately?The Console platform provides aTagsfeature that can be used to distinguish securities as either long-term (held for more than 1 year) or short-term (held for less than 1 year). Once the securities have been tagged, filters on Console can be used to view them accordingly. To know the steps to add the tags, seeHow to add tags on Zerodha’s Console?Although holdings can be viewed separately, they cannot be sold separately. Income-tax guidelines(WEB)require that the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method be used to account for the purchase and sale of securities. This means that the securities purchased first will be considered sold first from the demat account.While filing income tax returns, it is the responsibility of the investor to indicate whether the sale resulted in a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss. Although securities in a demat are not differentiated by purchase date, the IT department and Zerodha's P&L statements follow the FIFO method. Therefore, when determining the purchase price and capital gains or losses, the securities purchased first will be considered sold first.Example ScenarioThe investor held 10 quantities of Infosys for two years.15 additional quantities were purchased with an expectation of an upside, resulting in a total quantity of 25.15 quantities were sold following the FIFO method.If the selling price is higher than the buying price, the first 10 quantities held for more than two years are subject to Long Term Capital Gain (LTCG).The P&L for the remaining 5 quantities sold will be evaluated based on the buying price of the recently purchased stock to determine short-term capital gains.Did you know?Zerodha receives requests from clients inquiring whether they can change the order of consideration of the buying price when selling a stock or create custom short and long-term holdings for the same stock. However, as previously mentioned, Zerodha is unable to accommodate these requests as they must adhere to the income tax guidelines(WEB).Related articlesHow does the new long term capital gain tax work?How are the dividends on Liquid ETFs and Liquid BeES taxed?Rights Issues and Rights Entitlements (RE) - FAQsWhat are the applicable taxes for G-secs?How does Zerodha deduct TDS for NRI NON-PIS accounts?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is tax loss harvesting?
Content: What is tax loss harvesting?Tax-loss harvesting is a practice of selling a security that has incurred a loss to help investors reduce or offset taxes on any capital gains income subject to taxation. This practice is accomplished byharvestingthe loss.Example scenarioIf an individual earns ₹1 lakh in Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) this year, they must pay 15% of this amount as taxes, which amounts to ₹15,000.Additionally, if the individual holds stocks with an unrealized loss of ₹60,000, they can sell these stocks to reduce their net STCG to ₹40,000. This would require paying 15% of ₹40,000, which amounts to ₹6,000 in taxes, resulting in a tax savings of ₹9,000.This process of selling stocks to harvest losses and save on taxes is known as tax-loss harvesting.While there is no explicit regulation in India that disallows tax loss harvesting, in the US, if stocks are sold and bought back within 30 days just to reduce taxes on realised gains, they are called wash sales, and taxes are disallowed to be offset. It is advisable for clients trading and investing in India to consult a Chartered Accountant (CA) while filing income tax returns, as they could potentially be questioned by the income tax authorities during tax scrutiny if the same stock is sold and bought back to save on the taxes.A report of the tax-loss harvesting opportunity in the Zerodha account can be accessed by visitingconsole.zerodha.com/reports/tax-loss-harvesting/eq.Visitzerodha.com/varsity/module/markets-and-taxation/to learn everything about taxation when trading or investing.To learn more about how this strategy can be used to plan taxes, visitzrd.sh/tax-loss-harvesting-22.Did you know?The buy average and P&L in Console are calculated using the FIFO (First In First Out) method. If a stock under short term loss and long-term profit is held, the entire holding must be sold to book the short-term capital loss. However, this will also book the stock's long-term capital gains.While computing the long-term capital gains and harvest opportunity, the first ₹1 lakh of long-term gains is tax-free. This is not considered in the tax-loss harvesting report on Console.There will be no tax-loss harvesting opportunity when there are no realised profits or if realized losses are greater than the realized profits.Verifying the buy average and P&L before deciding to sell is advised. It is best to take the help of a CA.Related articlesWhat are the tax benefits of investing in NPS?What are ELSS funds, and how can the ELSS statement be downloaded?Can Zerodha provide reports in either softcopy or hardcopy format with a seal and signature?How to gift securities?What is an Annual Information Statement (AIS) ?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: How does the new long term capital gain tax work?
Content: How does the new long term capital gain tax work?If shares or mutual fund units are sold after being held for one year or longer, any gains exceeding ₹1,00,000 per annum are subject to a 10% long-term capital gain (LTCG) tax, along with a 4% health and education cess.This is grandfathered until January 31, 2018, implying that any gains made before this date are exempt from taxes. Only subsequent gains will be subject to a 10% tax. In this context, grandfathered refers to the fact that for shares held for more than a year and sold after January 31st, the purchase price will be calculated based on the higher of the two prices: the actual purchase price or the price on January 31, 2018.Example scenarioA share was purchased in January 2015 at a price of ₹500.In April 2018, the share was sold for ₹1000.The share's price on January 31, 2018 was ₹700.The LTCG tax would be applicable on ₹300.If the share was sold in April for ₹650. The purchase price of ₹700 cannot be considered to claim a loss.Instead, the sale price of ₹650 will be considered as the new purchase price, rendering it tax-exempt.Download the tax P&L to see LTCG tax liability. To learn more, seeWhere can I find the holding period of my investments and the tax liability based on the grandfather clause of LTCG?This rule is applicable from 1st April 2018. So, there will be no LTCG tax on shares sold up to this date.

Content: How are the dividends on Liquid ETFs and Liquid BeES taxed?For a video walkthrough on downloading reports for tax filing, seeHow to download reports to file your taxes?Dividends on Liquid ETFs and Liquid BeES are taxed as per the income tax slab rate of the investor. When the units are sold, the amount on which tax is already paid is treated as the cost of acquisition, and the gains are then taxed under income from capital gains.Example scenario1,000 units of Liquid BeES were purchased at ₹1,000 a unit. A dividend of 35 units was received and held for the financial year. The value of these dividend units will be taxed at the slab rate of the investor (35 units*₹1,000* slab rate).When the dividend units are sold, the actual values of dividends received will be considered as the acquisition cost, i.e. 35 units*₹1,000 per unit, and the profit realised will be taxed based on the holding period.The Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) are taxed at 15% for holdings held for less than 3 years, and the Long Term Capital Gains are taxed at 10% (0% for first ₹1,00,000) for holdings held for more than 3 years.Did you know?If the dividends cross ₹5,000, an additional TDS of 10% is applicable.To know more about taxation, visitzerodha.com/varsity/module/markets-and-taxation.Related articlesWhy are the returns on liquid ETFs like Liquidbees, DSP Liquid ETF, and ICICI Liquid ETF lesser than the returns displayed on their websites?What does the Collateral (liquid funds) under Funds mean?Will Zerodha provide margin on liquid funds?What does Charges on the Kite order window mean?Is securities transaction tax (STT) levied on exchange traded  funds (ETFs)?××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are Direct Mutual Funds?
Content: What are Direct Mutual Funds?Direct Mutual Funds enable investors to purchase mutual funds directly from the Asset Management Company (AMC) or fund house, eliminating the need for an intermediary such as a distributor. This direct approach saves cost, as investors can bypass commissions and fees associated with traditional mutual fund investing.For instance, if someone wishes to purchase an apple, they may choose to visit their nearest supermarket for this purpose. In this scenario, the supermarket is an intermediary connecting the buyer with the farmer. If one were to bypass this intermediary or the middleman and buy apples directly from the farmer, they could save the commission or markup that would otherwise be paid to the supermarket.What is a fund house or Asset Management Company (AMC)?A fund house, also known as an Asset Management Company is an establishment that invests a pool of funds (which are called mutual funds) from various investors into a variety of financial instruments like Stocks, Bonds, Government Securities, and so on. A few examples of fund houses are DSP Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund, Nippon India Mutual Fund, etc. There are about 44 Asset Management Companies in India.Who is a distributor?A Mutual Fund distributor is a person or an organization that facilitates the mutual fund transaction between the investor and the AMC. The commissions paid out by AMC are the income for the distributor and are paid by taking a small percentage from the invested value.For instance, when investing ₹1000 in a fund through a distributor, the AMC deducts ₹10 from the funds and transfers it to the distributor, reducing the initial investment to ₹990. On the other hand, opting to purchase a mutual fund through the direct mode eliminates distributor involvement and commission payments, resulting in an initial investment of ₹1000 and, subsequently, higher returns compared to the regular fund counterpart.

Title: What are the advantages of using Coin?
Content: What are the advantages of using Coin?Following are the advantages of investing using the Coin app:Investing in direct funds on Coin is commission-free. Direct Plans of AMCs do not charge commission expenses. Regular plans pay commissions to the broker or distributors. This commission is added to the expense ratio of the scheme. Regular plans have a higher expense ratio than Direct plans, which can amount to as much as 1% of the AUM (the value of holdings) as a commission from Mutual Funds annually. Brokers and distributors generally take these commissions as a percentage of the AUM directly from the AMC or Fund house selected under a Regular plan, lowering returns by the percentage taken as commission. To learn more about direct mutual funds, seeWhat are Direct Mutual Funds?The step-up SIP feature allows for an automatic increase in SIP amounts by a predefined percentage. In effect, regular plan investments yield lower returns compared to Direct Plans due to these commission expenses. To learn more about set-up SIP, seeWhat is step-up SIP, and how can it be set on Coin web?Easy Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) can be started, paused, or stopped as needed. SIP values can be increased or decreased at will.Net Asset Value (NAV) order tracking and a choice of over 41 Asset Management Companies (AMCs) and 2200 funds collectively are available. Orders to purchase or redeem funds based on NAV can be placed, similar to stocks.Mutual funds in an electronic demat format provide a single portfolio view of all stocks and mutual funds in one place. They are easy to pledge and take a loan against in case of emergency.A single consolidated statement includes P&L, visualizations, and more. It serves as a convenient reference for claiming tax deductions for ELSS Scheme as per Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.MF or stocks in DEMAT format are much easier to claim by dependents (nominees of DEMAT) in case of death. Direct plans with multiple AMC’s (Fund houses) would otherwise mean multiple folios, which would be difficult to aggregate and claim.Sectors and companies in which the fund house invests can be viewed, and mutual funds can be compared.Related articlesHow to convert regular mutual fund investment to direct mutual fund?Why is the NAV for direct mutual funds higher than regular mutual funds?Where can clients learn more about investing in mutual funds and Coin?How to transfer mutual funds from other platform to Coin?Why can regular plans be pledged but not direct plans of the same mutual fund scheme?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is the minimum initial investment for SIPs in some schemes higher on Coin?
Content: Why is the minimum initial investment for SIPs in some schemes higher on Coin?There are two types of purchase orders when investing in a mutual fund:Lump sum orders- A type of order where you make an investment in one go.SIP orders- A type of order where you invest a certain predetermined amount at a regular interval.Whenever you place an SIP order at Zerodha Coin, we do not follow the conventional SIP model. All your orders are sent to the AMCs (fund houses) as lump sum investment orders on your chosen SIP dates. Lump-sum investments consist of 'Minimum Initial Investment Amount' and 'Minimum Additional purchase Amount'.The Minimum Initial Investment Amount is the minimum amount you need to invest in a fund for the very first time you invest.The Minimum Additional purchase Amount is the minimum amount that you need to invest in all the subsequent investments for the selected fund.Here is an example :Assume you intend to start an SIP with SBI Bluechip fund.SBI Bluechip fund has the minimum initial investment amount as Rs.5,000/- and the minimum additional purchase amount as Rs.1,000/-So your first investment has to be Rs.5,000/- or more.The subsequent SIP amounts can be Rs.1,000/- or more.Please note, both these amounts are set by the AMC.Since the AMC specifics Minimum Initial Investment Amount for the first time you invest, the  SIP amount can be higher on coin compared to the AMC site.Why is my SIP processed as a lump sum? Are there any advantages to it?Treating your SIP as a lump sum allows you more control over your SIPs.

Title: What is an SIP?
Content: What is an SIP?Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a method used by investors to invest regular amounts of money in a mutual fund, stock market, or some other type of investment. Instead of investing a large sum all at once, an investor can invest a smaller amount of money at regular intervals (such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly). The advantage of an SIP is that it can help mitigate the risk of market volatility. Since investing occurs at regular intervals, more units are bought when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high.

Title: Why is the NAV for direct mutual funds higher than regular mutual funds?
Content: Why is the NAV for direct mutual funds higher than regular mutual funds?To understand why the NAV of a direct fund is higher than a regular fund, one has to understand the concept of the expense ratio of a mutual fund.The expense ratio is the amount of money that is paid to the fund house towards managing investor’s money. For instance, if a client invests ₹5,000 with an expense ratio of 1.5%, the client pays the fund house ₹75 a year to manage their money.The fund’s NAV is arrived at after deducting the expense ratio. Hence, the higher the expense ratio, the higher the deduction and the lower the NAV. The expense ratio in regular funds is higher than the expense ratio in direct funds because of which the NAV of regular funds will be lower than direct funds.To learn everything about mutual funds seeIntroduction to Mutual Funds – Varsity by Zerodha.Related articlesHow are SWP redemption units calculated?What does NAV mean?What is the impact of dividends on the NAV if the Income Distribution Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) scheme has paid dividends?How long will it take for mutual fund units to show up in the demat account?Why is the current mutual fund value on Console based on the T-2 days NAV?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are open ended and closed ended funds?
Content: What are open ended and closed ended funds?Open-ended Funds:An open-end fund is a type of mutual fund that does not have restrictions on the number of shares the fund can issue. Purchasing shares creates new ones, whereas selling shares takes them out of circulation. Shares are bought and sold on demand at their net asset value (NAV), which is based on the value of the fund’s underlying securities and is calculated at the end of the trading day.Close-ended Funds:The unit capital of closed-ended funds is fixed, and they sell a specific number of units. Unlike in open-ended funds, investors cannot buy the units of a closed-ended fund after its NFO (New Fund Offer) period is over. A closed-end fund raises a prescribed amount of capital only once through an NFO by issuing a fixed number of shares, which are purchased by investors in the closed-end fund as stock. The stock price of a closed-end fund fluctuates according to market forces, such as supply and demand, as well as the changing values of the securities in the fund's holdings.Related articlesWhy are mutual fund investments displayed under Kite holdings?What is the procedure to dematerialise mutual funds?Why do the colour on bar charts and volume bars not match sometimes?How to close the Zerodha account?What is the process to close a non individual Zerodha account?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: How does taxation work for mutual fund investments?
Content: How does taxation work for mutual fund investments?1) Equity FundsEquity fundsessentially mean any fund which hasmore than 65% invested in equity.For example, large-cap funds, small-cap funds, balanced funds(equity-oriented), etc.Short Term Capital Gains(STCG) of 15%will be applicable if the units are sold within 1 year of allotment.Long-Term Capital Gains(LTCG) will be 10% if the units are sold after 1 year of allotment (if your capital gains are more than 1 lac a year)- This is grandfathered till 31 Jan 2018. Meaning, whatever gains you had until 31 Jan 2018 are tax-free. Only FURTHER gains will be taxed at 10%.Dividendsreceived inexcess of Rs 10 lacs,will be chargeable at the rate of10%.Short-term capital loss can only be offset against STCG or LTCGLong-term capital loss can only be offset against LTCG.2) Non - Equity FundsThis is funds in which the percentage ofequity investments is less than 65%.Eg: debt schemes, liquid schemes, etc.STCG will be applicable as per the tax bracket.LTCG will be applicable at 20% after indexation. Indexation means to adjust the cost of purchase as per the inflation index number which the government releases every year. Let's assume, you purchased a unit at Rs 100 in 2012-13 and sold the unit at Rs 150 in 2018-19. Thecost inflation indexis 200 for 2012-13 and 280 for 2018-19 respectively. Then the indexed cost of acquisition (100*280)/200 is Rs 140. The capital gains post indexation is Rs 150 - 140 = Rs 10 (instead of 150 - 100). So, a 20% tax on 10 is Rs 2 per unit.Dividends from non-equity schemes will be given after deducting DDT (Dividend Distribution Tax) which is 28.84%. So, it is best to choose a growth-oriented scheme in this case.Short-term capital loss can be offset against STCG or LTCGLong-term capital loss can only be offset against LTCGIn both cases, the capital loss cannot be offset against any Head of Income.Note: The content above is in the context of taxation for retail individual investors only. This is applicable under the current taxation rules and could be subject to changes.

Title: How to calculate mutual fund returns?
Content: How to calculate mutual fund returns?As an investor, you can calculate your Return on Investments (ROI), either for lump sum or SIPs in different ways. The following are some of the methods of calculating returns along with scenarios where it is applicable to use them:Case 1:Lump sum investment for less than a year.Method of Calculation:Absolute ReturnLet’s say you made a lump sum investment of Rs. 2,75,000 on 28 May 2018 and the present value of the investment is Rs. 325000. In such a case, calculating the absolute return will give a true picture of your earnings.DateAmount2018/05/28-2750002018/12/10325000Absolute Return18.18%*Negative Values indicate cash outflows.Absolute Return % = (Current Value - Investment Value) / Investment Value x 100= (325000 - 275000) / 275000 * 100= 18.18The absolute return shows the growth of your investment without considering the investment time period. It is simply the percentage difference in the money you had before investing and the money you have now.Case 2:Lump sum investment over multiple years.Method of Calculation:CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate)When a lump sum investment is made for more than a year, CAGR provides the right picture of your returns. CAGR represents the consistent rate at which the investment would have grown if the investment had compounded at the same rate each year.Checkthisout for more information on CAGR.DateAmount2018/05/23-2750002019/07/23325000Duration425 daysCAGR15.43%*Negative Values indicate cash outflows.CAGR = [(Current Value / Investment Value)^(365/Number of Days)] - 1= [(325000/275000)^(365/425)] - 1= 0.1543 [15.43%]Case 3:SIP for less than a yearMethod of Calculation:XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)Absolute profit to be considered for investments less than a year.Case 4:SIP for greater than a year.Method of Calculation:XIRRSimilar to Case 3, XIRR is also applicable when calculating the return when your SIP is for greater than one year as well.DateAmount2017/12/05-100002018/01/05-100002018/02/05-100002018/03/05-100002018/04/05-100002018/05/05-100002018/06/05-100002018/07/05-100002018/08/05-100002018/09/05-100002018/10/05-100002018/11/05-100002018/12/05-100002019/01/05-100002019/01/07180000XIRR54.96%*Negative Values indicate cash outflows.Read more on calculation of Mutual Fund returns in detailhereon Varsity.Related articlesHow to calculate returns on government securities?How will interest get paid for G-secs?What does exit load mean and how to calculate it for mutual fund investments?How to check the details of a mutual fund investment on Coin app?What is XIRR and how to check it in Zerodha?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

To learn more about the factsheet, visitzerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-mutual-fund-fact-sheet.Example scenarioAn investment of ₹50,000 is made in a mutual fund with an exit load of 1% and a NAV of ₹50. Therefore, the client would have received 1000 units for their investment.The client decides to redeem 1000 units of the mutual fund when the NAV is ₹60.The exit load of 1% will be deducted from the latest NAV, i.e. ₹60. The calculation will be as follows: (1% of ₹60) * 1000 units = ₹600.

Title: What are Direct Mutual Funds?
Content: What are Direct Mutual Funds?Direct Mutual Funds enable investors to purchase mutual funds directly from the Asset Management Company (AMC) or fund house, eliminating the need for an intermediary such as a distributor. This direct approach saves cost, as investors can bypass commissions and fees associated with traditional mutual fund investing.For instance, if someone wishes to purchase an apple, they may choose to visit their nearest supermarket for this purpose. In this scenario, the supermarket is an intermediary connecting the buyer with the farmer. If one were to bypass this intermediary or the middleman and buy apples directly from the farmer, they could save the commission or markup that would otherwise be paid to the supermarket.What is a fund house or Asset Management Company (AMC)?A fund house, also known as an Asset Management Company is an establishment that invests a pool of funds (which are called mutual funds) from various investors into a variety of financial instruments like Stocks, Bonds, Government Securities, and so on. A few examples of fund houses are DSP Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund, Nippon India Mutual Fund, etc. There are about 44 Asset Management Companies in India.Who is a distributor?A Mutual Fund distributor is a person or an organization that facilitates the mutual fund transaction between the investor and the AMC. The commissions paid out by AMC are the income for the distributor and are paid by taking a small percentage from the invested value.For instance, when investing ₹1000 in a fund through a distributor, the AMC deducts ₹10 from the funds and transfers it to the distributor, reducing the initial investment to ₹990. On the other hand, opting to purchase a mutual fund through the direct mode eliminates distributor involvement and commission payments, resulting in an initial investment of ₹1000 and, subsequently, higher returns compared to the regular fund counterpart.

Title: What are the advantages of using Coin?
Content: What are the advantages of using Coin?Following are the advantages of investing using the Coin app:Investing in direct funds on Coin is commission-free. Direct Plans of AMCs do not charge commission expenses. Regular plans pay commissions to the broker or distributors. This commission is added to the expense ratio of the scheme. Regular plans have a higher expense ratio than Direct plans, which can amount to as much as 1% of the AUM (the value of holdings) as a commission from Mutual Funds annually. Brokers and distributors generally take these commissions as a percentage of the AUM directly from the AMC or Fund house selected under a Regular plan, lowering returns by the percentage taken as commission. To learn more about direct mutual funds, seeWhat are Direct Mutual Funds?The step-up SIP feature allows for an automatic increase in SIP amounts by a predefined percentage. In effect, regular plan investments yield lower returns compared to Direct Plans due to these commission expenses. To learn more about set-up SIP, seeWhat is step-up SIP, and how can it be set on Coin web?Easy Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) can be started, paused, or stopped as needed. SIP values can be increased or decreased at will.Net Asset Value (NAV) order tracking and a choice of over 41 Asset Management Companies (AMCs) and 2200 funds collectively are available. Orders to purchase or redeem funds based on NAV can be placed, similar to stocks.Mutual funds in an electronic demat format provide a single portfolio view of all stocks and mutual funds in one place. They are easy to pledge and take a loan against in case of emergency.A single consolidated statement includes P&L, visualizations, and more. It serves as a convenient reference for claiming tax deductions for ELSS Scheme as per Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.MF or stocks in DEMAT format are much easier to claim by dependents (nominees of DEMAT) in case of death. Direct plans with multiple AMC’s (Fund houses) would otherwise mean multiple folios, which would be difficult to aggregate and claim.Sectors and companies in which the fund house invests can be viewed, and mutual funds can be compared.Related articlesHow to convert regular mutual fund investment to direct mutual fund?Why is the NAV for direct mutual funds higher than regular mutual funds?Where can clients learn more about investing in mutual funds and Coin?How to transfer mutual funds from other platform to Coin?Why can regular plans be pledged but not direct plans of the same mutual fund scheme?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is the minimum initial investment for SIPs in some schemes higher on Coin?
Content: Why is the minimum initial investment for SIPs in some schemes higher on Coin?There are two types of purchase orders when investing in a mutual fund:Lump sum orders- A type of order where you make an investment in one go.SIP orders- A type of order where you invest a certain predetermined amount at a regular interval.Whenever you place an SIP order at Zerodha Coin, we do not follow the conventional SIP model. All your orders are sent to the AMCs (fund houses) as lump sum investment orders on your chosen SIP dates. Lump-sum investments consist of 'Minimum Initial Investment Amount' and 'Minimum Additional purchase Amount'.The Minimum Initial Investment Amount is the minimum amount you need to invest in a fund for the very first time you invest.The Minimum Additional purchase Amount is the minimum amount that you need to invest in all the subsequent investments for the selected fund.Here is an example :Assume you intend to start an SIP with SBI Bluechip fund.SBI Bluechip fund has the minimum initial investment amount as Rs.5,000/- and the minimum additional purchase amount as Rs.1,000/-So your first investment has to be Rs.5,000/- or more.The subsequent SIP amounts can be Rs.1,000/- or more.Please note, both these amounts are set by the AMC.Since the AMC specifics Minimum Initial Investment Amount for the first time you invest, the  SIP amount can be higher on coin compared to the AMC site.Why is my SIP processed as a lump sum? Are there any advantages to it?Treating your SIP as a lump sum allows you more control over your SIPs. You can select the SIP dates and frequency as per your convenience & you can easily pause, modify,step upor restart your SIP online without any hassle or document submission.I want to invest in the normal SIP without the initial investment order. What do I do?To help out clients who want to invest in SIP orders which are not created internally by the Zerodha system, we have the provision of AMC SIPs. These are purchase orders wherein you set up the SIP with an AMC directly, using the Coin interface.In any case, the minimum initial investment amount varies between different AMCs and schemes. So, some schemes might start at Rs 5000, Rs 1000, or Rs 500.Related articlesDoes Zerodha provide leverage against the available funds in my trading account?How to verify if Zerodha has passed the margin penalty to the exchange?Mutual funds for minor accounts - FAQsWhat is the Coin login ID and how to login to the Coin app?How to complete payments for the purchase orders on Coin?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why were the funds not automatically debited as per the Coin SIP schedule?
Content: Why were the funds not automatically debited as per the Coin SIP schedule?The SIP must be linked to the mandate to ensure the funds are automatically debited according to the SIP schedule. The debit request won't be generated if the SIP is not linked. However, the funds may not be debited even when the SIP is linked to the mandate in the following cases:Insufficient opening balance:If the opening balance on the transaction (T) day is less than the SIP amount, the SIP will fail. Funds transferred to the bank account on the T day will not be considered. Only the opening balance on the T day is considered for fund transfer.Example scenarioIf a SIP of ₹5,000 is to be executed on April 5th, clients must ensure their bank account has sufficient balance on April 4th. If the opening balance on April 5th is ₹4,000 and enough funds are subsequently transferred to make up the SIP amount, the funds will not be debited, as the opening balance is insufficient.Rejected by the bank:If there is a sufficient opening balance in the bank account, but the fund transfer still gets rejected, clients are requested to contact their banks for further clarification.Related articlesWhy was the money debited from the bank account before the scheduled transaction day?Why are funds transferred using UPI not reflecting in the Zerodha account?What is a mandate and how to create them for SIPs on Coin web?What is a mandate and how to create them for SIPs on Coin app?Why did I receive a payment request from Zerodha which I did not raise?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What is an SIP?
Content: What is an SIP?Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a method used by investors to invest regular amounts of money in a mutual fund, stock market, or some other type of investment. Instead of investing a large sum all at once, an investor can invest a smaller amount of money at regular intervals (such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly). The advantage of an SIP is that it can help mitigate the risk of market volatility. Since investing occurs at regular intervals, more units are bought when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high.

Content: Why is the NAV for direct mutual funds higher than regular mutual funds?To understand why the NAV of a direct fund is higher than a regular fund, one has to understand the concept of the expense ratio of a mutual fund.The expense ratio is the amount of money that is paid to the fund house towards managing investor’s money. For instance, if a client invests ₹5,000 with an expense ratio of 1.5%, the client pays the fund house ₹75 a year to manage their money.The fund’s NAV is arrived at after deducting the expense ratio. Hence, the higher the expense ratio, the higher the deduction and the lower the NAV. The expense ratio in regular funds is higher than the expense ratio in direct funds because of which the NAV of regular funds will be lower than direct funds.To learn everything about mutual funds seeIntroduction to Mutual Funds – Varsity by Zerodha.Related articlesHow are SWP redemption units calculated?What does NAV mean?What is the impact of dividends on the NAV if the Income Distribution Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) scheme has paid dividends?How long will it take for mutual fund units to show up in the demat account?Why is the current mutual fund value on Console based on the T-2 days NAV?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: What are open ended and closed ended funds?
Content: What are open ended and closed ended funds?Open-ended Funds:An open-end fund is a type of mutual fund that does not have restrictions on the number of shares the fund can issue. Purchasing shares creates new ones, whereas selling shares takes them out of circulation. Shares are bought and sold on demand at their net asset value (NAV), which is based on the value of the fund’s underlying securities and is calculated at the end of the trading day.Close-ended Funds:The unit capital of closed-ended funds is fixed, and they sell a specific number of units. Unlike in open-ended funds, investors cannot buy the units of a closed-ended fund after its NFO (New Fund Offer) period is over. A closed-end fund raises a prescribed amount of capital only once through an NFO by issuing a fixed number of shares, which are purchased by investors in the closed-end fund as stock. The stock price of a closed-end fund fluctuates according to market forces, such as supply and demand, as well as the changing values of the securities in the fund's holdings.Related articlesWhy are mutual fund investments displayed under Kite holdings?What is the procedure to dematerialise mutual funds?Why do the colour on bar charts and volume bars not match sometimes?How to close the Zerodha account?What is the process to close a non individual Zerodha account?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: How does taxation work for mutual fund investments?
Content: How does taxation work for mutual fund investments?1) Equity FundsEquity fundsessentially mean any fund which hasmore than 65% invested in equity.For example, large-cap funds, small-cap funds, balanced funds(equity-oriented), etc.Short Term Capital Gains(STCG) of 15%will be applicable if the units are sold within 1 year of allotment.Long-Term Capital Gains(LTCG) will be 10% if the units are sold after 1 year of allotment (if your capital gains are more than 1 lac a year)- This is grandfathered till 31 Jan 2018. Meaning, whatever gains you had until 31 Jan 2018 are tax-free. Only FURTHER gains will be taxed at 10%.Dividendsreceived inexcess of Rs 10 lacs,will be chargeable at the rate of10%.Short-term capital loss can only be offset against STCG or LTCGLong-term capital loss can only be offset against LTCG.2) Non - Equity FundsThis is funds in which the percentage ofequity investments is less than 65%.Eg: debt schemes, liquid schemes, etc.STCG will be applicable as per the tax bracket.LTCG will be applicable at 20% after indexation. Indexation means to adjust the cost of purchase as per the inflation index number which the government releases every year. Let's assume, you purchased a unit at Rs 100 in 2012-13 and sold the unit at Rs 150 in 2018-19. Thecost inflation indexis 200 for 2012-13 and 280 for 2018-19 respectively. Then the indexed cost of acquisition (100*280)/200 is Rs 140. The capital gains post indexation is Rs 150 - 140 = Rs 10 (instead of 150 - 100). So, a 20% tax on 10 is Rs 2 per unit.Dividends from non-equity schemes will be given after deducting DDT (Dividend Distribution Tax) which is 28.84%. So, it is best to choose a growth-oriented scheme in this case.Short-term capital loss can be offset against STCG or LTCGLong-term capital loss can only be offset against LTCGIn both cases, the capital loss cannot be offset against any Head of Income.Note: The content above is in the context of taxation for retail individual investors only. This is applicable under the current taxation rules and could be subject to changes.

Title: How to calculate mutual fund returns?
Content: How to calculate mutual fund returns?As an investor, you can calculate your Return on Investments (ROI), either for lump sum or SIPs in different ways. The following are some of the methods of calculating returns along with scenarios where it is applicable to use them:Case 1:Lump sum investment for less than a year.Method of Calculation:Absolute ReturnLet’s say you made a lump sum investment of Rs. 2,75,000 on 28 May 2018 and the present value of the investment is Rs. 325000. In such a case, calculating the absolute return will give a true picture of your earnings.DateAmount2018/05/28-2750002018/12/10325000Absolute Return18.18%*Negative Values indicate cash outflows.Absolute Return % = (Current Value - Investment Value) / Investment Value x 100= (325000 - 275000) / 275000 * 100= 18.18The absolute return shows the growth of your investment without considering the investment time period. It is simply the percentage difference in the money you had before investing and the money you have now.Case 2:Lump sum investment over multiple years.Method of Calculation:CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate)When a lump sum investment is made for more than a year, CAGR provides the right picture of your returns. CAGR represents the consistent rate at which the investment would have grown if the investment had compounded at the same rate each year.Checkthisout for more information on CAGR.DateAmount2018/05/23-2750002019/07/23325000Duration425 daysCAGR15.43%*Negative Values indicate cash outflows.CAGR = [(Current Value / Investment Value)^(365/Number of Days)] - 1= [(325000/275000)^(365/425)] - 1= 0.1543 [15.43%]Case 3:SIP for less than a yearMethod of Calculation:XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)Absolute profit to be considered for investments less than a year.Case 4:SIP for greater than a year.Method of Calculation:XIRRSimilar to Case 3, XIRR is also applicable when calculating the return when your SIP is for greater than one year as well.DateAmount2017/12/05-100002018/01/05-100002018/02/05-100002018/03/05-100002018/04/05-100002018/05/05-100002018/06/05-100002018/07/05-100002018/08/05-100002018/09/05-100002018/10/05-100002018/11/05-100002018/12/05-100002019/01/05-100002019/01/07180000XIRR54.96%*Negative Values indicate cash outflows.Read more on calculation of Mutual Fund returns in detailhereon Varsity.Related articlesHow to calculate returns on government securities?How will interest get paid for G-secs?What does exit load mean and how to calculate it for mutual fund investments?How to check the details of a mutual fund investment on Coin app?What is XIRR and how to check it in Zerodha?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

To learn more about the factsheet, visitzerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-mutual-fund-fact-sheet.Example scenarioAn investment of ₹50,000 is made in a mutual fund with an exit load of 1% and a NAV of ₹50. Therefore, the client would have received 1000 units for their investment.The client decides to redeem 1000 units of the mutual fund when the NAV is ₹60.The exit load of 1% will be deducted from the latest NAV, i.e. ₹60.

Title: What are covered bonds?
Content: What are covered bonds?Covered bonds represent a type of debt securities issued by banks or Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), which are backed by a pool of assets. These bonds assure investors that in the event of the issuer's default, the funds can be recovered from the collateralized pool of assets.The structure of a covered bond is as follows:The bank or NBFC issues bonds to investors.A cover pool consisting of secured loans is established as a precautionary measure.At the bond's maturity, the bank or NBFC repays the principal amount plus interest to the investors.If the issuer fails to make the payment, the amount can be recovered from the cover pool.The cover pool typically comprises various types of secured loans such as housing, vehicle, gold, and others.Covered bonds provide dual recourse, unlike secured corporate bonds that only offer recourse against the issuer. This means that investors have a first recourse against the issuer and a bankruptcy-protected recourse against the issuer's assets (the cover pool). Due to this additional layer of security, covered bonds generally receive higher credit ratings than the issuer's standalone rating.Did you know?Covered bonds cannot be pledged as collateral with Zerodha. The list of approved instruments that can be pledged for margins and the applicable haircut %can be found by visitingzerodha.com/approved-securities.Related articlesCan covered bonds be pledged as collateral to receive collateral margin at Zerodha?What is Zerodha's policy on the physical settlement of equity derivatives on expiry?Why is margin benefit not provided for the covered call strategy in Zerodha?How to buy NCDs, bonds and tax-free bonds on Kite?××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.

Title: Why is the current mutual fund value on Console based on the T-2 days NAV?
Content: Why is the current mutual fund value on Console based on the T-2 days NAV?The current mutual fund value on Console is based on the T-2 days NAV for the following reasons:For most Mutual Fund schemes, the NAV (Net Asset Value) is officially declared by the AMC at the end of the trading day, usually around 11 PM. This information is then transmitted to AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India), which updates its data by midnight or sometimes as late as 3-4 AM on the following day, which we refer to as T+1 day. For different types of schemes:For Equity Schemes, the NAV is announced by 9 PM on the same trading day (T-day).For Liquid Schemes, the NAV is announced by 11 PM on T-day.For schemes with international assets, the NAV is announced by 12 PM on T+1 day.Additionally, for international schemes, a report known as the Bhav copy, containing daily trading data for Mutual Funds, is generated by T+1 day at 3 PM. Console uses this Bhav copy to calculate the Mutual Fund Profit and Loss (P&L) on the evening of T+1 day. As a result, by T+2 day, the information displayed on Console accurately represents the Mutual Fund's value as of T-day. This approach ensures that clients receive the most precise and up-to-date representation of their holdings. The holdings data for mutual funds as per T-1 days NAV can be tracked on Coin.Related articlesWhy are mutual fund investments displayed under Kite holdings?Mutual funds for minor accounts - FAQsHow to view mutual fund investments on Coin web?How to rematerialise mutual funds?What is the procedure to dematerialise mutual funds?Still need help?Create a ticket××Open ticketsWe see that you have the following ticket(s) open:If you have the same query, check and update the existing tickethere.
